From supermodels, reality stars, and music moguls, here is a&nbsp;list of the ten hottest women in the lives of these players who will remind you, once again, how much you miss out when you're not playing for the big leagues.</p><h2 class=split>1.&nbsp;Katherine Webb</h2><p>The gorgeous 29-year-old Katherine Webb is the perfect brunette bombshell. The model, beauty queen, and former Miss Alabama USA is married to Raymond Anthony&nbsp;"AJ"&nbsp;McCarron Jr. who is the quarterback&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Oakland Raiders. She's got the beach body you can only wish for and a super sharp jawline.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>2. Ciara&nbsp;</h2><p>She's a household name in pop and R&B music not only because of her impeccable talent but also because of her steamy music videos. Ciara Princess Harris is also a&nbsp;songwriter, record producer, dancer, model, and actress. She is married to&nbsp;Russell&nbsp;Carrington&nbsp;Wilson who is the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks. The 32-year-old is 5'8.5" and weighs 137 pounds. She is best known for her debut album 'Goodies', which was certified as 3x Platinum. With a dangerously curvy physique, a jawline that can cut glass and pouty lips, it's no surprise that she lands at number 2 on this list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>3. Gisele Bundchen</h2><p>Supermodel Gisele Bundchen is the wife of&nbsp;football quarterback Tom Brady who plays for the New England Patriots in the NFL. The 37 years old towers at 5’11” and weighs 126 lbs. If you just browse through her Instagram, you'll find she loves yoga and cardio and believes in the au naturale life. She's got the perfect washboard abs, piercing blue eyes, and messy blond locks which make her a treat to the eyes!</p><h2 class=split>4.&nbsp;Sasha Lee Dindayal</h2><p>Reality star&nbsp;Sasha Lee Dindayal is married to NFL player to Antonio Gates from San Diego Chargers. The two have had had a long run since he popped the question in 2011. Sasha also has her own line of football baby clothes called Wittle Ones.&nbsp; She's 30 years old, loves working out (clearly, check out that booty) and has hair that is always on point! She can be frequently seen posting saucy shots of herself on Instagram but hey, we are not complaining!</p><h2 class=split>5.&nbsp;Camille Kostek&nbsp;</h2><p>Camille Kostek is in a relationship with football tight end for the New England Patriots, Rob Gronkowski. This blonde bombshell is like a total beach babe - freckles, wavy hair and the perfect tan, not to mention the perfect beach bod. She's a Swimsuit Illustrated model and also big into body positivity. The 26-year-old gets her good looks from her mixed heritage which is Irish, Polish and Jamaican.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>6.&nbsp;Marissa Powell</h2><p>Beauty queen, model and actress Marissa Powell is married to Kyle Van Noy linebacker&nbsp;for the&nbsp;New England Patriots. She's known for her role in 'Ballers' that stars Dwayne Johnson. She was former Miss Utah USA so it's safe to say that Powell is as smart as she is gorgeous. She's also a singer who has performed with her group ‘Geniveve’ in numerous venues across the state of Utah, singing the National Anthem for over 10,000 people at the Rocky Mountain Cup for Real Salt Lake, as well as writing and performing original songs for many years. This 5'8" tall brunette boasts of voluptuous&nbsp;curves and smoldering blue eyes.&nbsp; Her most prominent feature is her shapely kissable lips and toned as hell abs.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>7.&nbsp; Kia Proctor&nbsp;</h2><p>Kia Proctor is the girlfriend of Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton. The brunette bombshell comes from a sexy job - she used to be a stripper. She's 29 years old and is 5'6" tall.&nbsp;She worked under her stage name Hazel and has worked as an exotic dancer for Washington DC Stadium, a popular strip club. She later went on to become a party host in Atlanta. She left her stripping and party hosting modeling later on and now makes hearts swoon with that amazing hourglass figure and enviable booty.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>8.&nbsp;Olivia Culpo</h2><p>A willowy petite body, curves in all the right places and a smile like sunshine, Olivia Culpo is one of the hottest NFL WAGS out there. She is currently dating Daniel James Amendola who plays wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins.&nbsp; She's a model, actress, and beauty queen who won the Miss Universe 2012 pageant, representing her home country of United States. She previously won the Miss Rhode Island USA competition, which was the first pageant she entered.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>9.&nbsp;Lilit Avagyan Bush</h2><p>Lilit Avagyan Bush is the wife of NFL player Reggie Bush. Reggie is most popular for his sex tape scandal with reality mogul Kim Kardashian and it may seem like he has a thing for curvy women. If you browse through Lilit's Instagram you'll know what we are talking about. The 31-year-old could solely be responsible for the rising temperatures - Lilit has curves to die for. She's multilingual - she can speak Russian, Armenian and English and she loves to dance. She's a fitness freak and frequently posts workout videos on her Insta.</p><h2 class=split>10. Jessie James Decker</h2><p>Jessie James Decker is a country singer and model and is wed to New England's patriots player Eric Decker. She's one of the most fun, playful WAGS out there and she can also rock the hell out of a bikini.&nbsp;She is from a military family, as her father served in the&nbsp;US Air Force. As a result, she lived in many areas:&nbsp;Germany,&nbsp;Iowa,&nbsp;Kentucky,&nbsp;Texas, and&nbsp;Louisiana. James has two younger siblings, Sydney Rae Bass and John James. She began singing at the age of two. Jessie is super toned, thanks to her love for working out.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoaWBitbDA056qrWWnlrS0ec2fow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sweep-easy-shark-tank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sweep Easy Shark Tank  Founder, Net Worth and Investment">&larr;
