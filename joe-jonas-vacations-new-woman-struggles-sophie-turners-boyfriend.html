But they coordinated in all-black looks. Stormi wore dark jeans and a long sleeve t-shirt, while Joe rocked a black hoodie with a bright red hat and sunglasses.</p><p>TMZ notes this is the first time Joe and Sophie have been seen together in public. They also don’t appear to be following each other on social media, suggesting their romance may be new and/or they’re trying to maintain a low-profile.</p><p>It's likely Joe is returning to the U.S. as his daughters are set to return to him after spending the <a href=#>holidays in the U.K. with their mother Sophie Turner</a>. The exes reached a temporary custody agreement in October, after Sophie accused Joe of kidnapping their children when he refused to allow them to go to Britain with Sophie, even though they were apparently planning to move their before their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophie-is-dating-a-british-aristocrat>Sophie Is Dating A British Aristocrat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sophie-turner-1.jpg><p>It's not only Joe who’s moving on from their relationship.
