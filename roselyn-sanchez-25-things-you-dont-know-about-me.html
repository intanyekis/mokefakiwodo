She and Winter, 46, have cohosted the “He Said, Ella Dijo” podcast together since 2019. It’s something that keeps the couple close — <a href=#>even when they disagree on things</a>.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“We’re always trying to find ways of collaborating, working together,” Sánchez told Us exclusively in October 2019 of her and the Rookie star’s on-air partnership. “If we work together, it means that we’re going to be located at the same place and that the family stays together.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The twosome have shared the small screen as well, teaming up for Hallmark’s 2019 film A Taste of Summer.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“We had a blast, but our process is very different. This was a light-hearted romantic comedy, so there was no point in us being all crazy serious. I goof around on set and have fun with everybody,” Winter told Us of his wife at the time. “Roselyn was so serious. I was looking at her like, ‘Why do you look like you want to kill me? We’re working together, we’re supposed to be falling in love!’”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While Sánchez loves teaming up with her other half, that doesn’t mean she hasn’t fantasized about other collaborations. “<a href=#><strong>Al Pacino</strong></a> is my dream costar. Since I started acting, [working with him] has been one of my goals,” she gushes to Us, adding that she also grew up being inspired by<a href=#> <strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Helen Hunt</strong></a> — whom she was “obsessed” with watching on the iconic sitcom Mad About You.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">New episodes of Fantasy Island season 2 air on FOX Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Keep scrolling to learn more about Sánchez:</p><p>1.
