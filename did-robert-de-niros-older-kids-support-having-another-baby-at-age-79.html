From Taxi Driver to The Godmother and more recent movies like Amsterdam and The Irishman, De Niro has always starred in films that people love and talk about for years. He is also famous for having a big family. In April 2023, <a href=#>De Niro and his girlfriend Tiffany Chen had a baby</a>, a daughter named Gia Virginia Chen De Niro. Since he was 79 at the time, this was notable news.</p><p>Robert De Niro has six children who are much older: 11-year-old Helen Grace De Niro, 24-year-old Elliot De Niro, 27-year-old twins Julian Aaron and Julian De Niro, 51-year-old Drena De Niro, and 46-year-old Raphael De Niro. Here's what it was like for the actor's six kids when they learned he was having another baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-robert-de-niro-say-about-having-his-seventh-child>What Did Robert De Niro Say About Having His Seventh Child?</h2><p>While of course some couples have multiple children, it's rare to hear of one couple having seven kids. The actor has many children because he has been in a few different relationships: <a href=#>Robert De Niro has had children with four partners</a>. But people might know more about his movies than they do about his romantic life. He often seems like a fairly mysterious figure who doesn't open up all that much about love or relationships.</p><p>However, De Niro has talked at length about his children, and that includes baby number seven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-intern.jpg><p>According to Page Six, when De Niro was at a movie premiere for About My Father in early May 2023, he answered a burning question that many have: was it a shock to become a dad for the seventh time?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many fans would think that he would have been overwhelmed at the prospect, he took the question in stride and seemed to be totally calm about the whole matter. He said "no," it wasn't shocking, and said he and Tiffany Chen wanted to have a child. He said, "How you could not plan that kind of thing?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Robert De Niro Has Grandkids Older Than His Children. Who Are They?</a></span></p><p>When speaking to Extra, Robert De Niro said,<strong> </strong>"I'm going to have a new one every year." It seemed like he was just being funny. Eight kids would definitely be a lot and he and his girlfriend are now busy with their little one. But this proves that he loves having kids in his life and thinks of being a father as a positive experience.</p><p>In fact, every time he talks about his kids, whether his new baby or other six children, he sounds content and calm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-de-niro-pointing-on-a-red-carpet.jpg><p>Robert De Niro isn't the only celebrity who had a baby at a later time in life. When interviewed on The Today Show in June 2023, De Niro mentioned that Al Pacino became a dad at 82. He said, "Listen, Al Pacino just had a baby. I was told yesterday morning. And he's a few years older than me. God bless him. I'm very happy for him."</p><h2 id=what-do-robert-de-niro-39-s-other-children-think-of-his-seventh-child>What Do Robert De Niro's Other Children Think Of His Seventh Child?</h2><p>Everyone is curious about how Robert De Niro's other children reacted when finding out that he was going to become a dad again. However, they don't seem to have said anything about it publicly.</p><p>In June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert De Niro talked about his kids</a> and explained that at that time, the siblings and the baby hadn't actually met. He said, "Not yet, but they will.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-de-niro-paid-his-nanny-over-46-an-hour-for-overtime-work-but-was-still-sued-by-her-for-thousands-1.jpg><p>It's unclear if that has changed at this time. If they did all get together, perhaps they wanted to keep it as a private family moment. Since there has been a lot of scrutiny about Robert De Niro having a seventh child at the age of 79, that would make sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Robert De Niro Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>It's possible that the family is waiting to meet the baby because De Niro and Tiffany Chen have had a lot going on. It's not only overwhelming and busy to have a new baby, but De Niro has still been making public appearances and going to movie premieres. He definitely still has a packed calendar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/drena-de-niro.jpg><p>There has also been some tragedy in the De Niro family. In July 2023, Us Weekly reported that Drena De Niro's son and Robert De Niro's grandson Leandro De Niro Rodriguez passed away.</p><p>While it's usually tough when a new baby comes into the family, the fact that De Niro's children are grown up now suggests that they might be fine with the situation. They would understand that he loves being a father and that he and Tiffany Chen are thrilled with their bundle of joy.</p><p>Robert De Niro's kids hasn't spoken to the media as much as he has. Drena De Niro seems to have been interviewed the most, and she has always spoken really highly of her famous dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-de-niro-with-long-hair.jpg><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert De Niro talked about his kids and acting</a> in an interview with Everything Zoomer in 2018, his daughter Drena was interviewed as well. She said that he had taught her a really good lesson.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Robert De Niro's Gave His Ex-Wife A Monthly Allowance After His Restaurant Chain Took A Massive Financial Hit</a></span></p><p>Drena explained, “The way he keeps his personal life intact and separate, that’s something I learned from him. How important it is that no matter what you’re doing publicly, you have that core of something that you protect. So I never want to be too detailed about our family life. That is the one thing that’s of my own and for my brothers and sister.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Everything Zoomer interview did reveal some interesting facts about how the family gets along, though. When asked about the age gap between his six kids, Robert De Niro said, “That’s kind of personal. I try to keep us all together as a family. Have things to do together. Have everybody have awareness of the family thing, so they look after each other, especially after I’m not around anymore. It’s a fragmented family. But I try my best to keep everybody together.”</p><p>Robert De Niro seems thrilled with baby number seven. Since it sounds like he has a very close family, it's very likely that his other children are just as excited for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdp7yjsdGtZJ2dXaO2s7vSZqalnJWneqy1w6xkrK2gpbyzwIyhmK%2Bhnpx6orrOrZ%2Beql2XrqPFjJqrZpmXmnp4hY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./keyonte-george-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-229589-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keyonte George Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr;
