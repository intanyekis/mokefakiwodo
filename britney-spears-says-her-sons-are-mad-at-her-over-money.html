I keep working so I can pay off mom’s legal fees and her house?” she continued. “Do you guys want me to continue to get better so I can continue giving your dad 40 grand a month [in child support]?”</p><p>The ‘Toxic’ songstress went on to allege that she believes her sons are angry with her since she’ll no longer have to pay child support once her eldest child turns 18 in a year and a half.</p><p>“Is the reason you guys have decided to be hateful is that it’s actually over in two years and you don’t get anything?” she continued.</p><p>In addition to Jayden, Britney shares a 16-year-old, Sean, with her ex-husband Kevin Federline, who has primary custody of the boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney claims she hasn’t seen her son in months, while Kevin says they’re trying to distance herself amid her controversial social media behavior (which has included nude posts and calling out her family).</p><p>The former Disney star has been vocal online since her decade-long conservatorship was ended last year.

In his interview, Jayden said he and his brother chose to skip the wedding since the rest of their family wasn’t invited.</p><p>"<a href=#>I'm really happy for them</a>, but she didn't invite the whole family," he said during the interview with 60 Minutes Australia. "And then if it was just gonna be me and Preston, I just don't see how that situation would have ended on good terms."</p><p>Jayden also defended his grandfather, Jamie Spears, who was in charge of his daughter’s conservatorship until right before it was terminated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everyone is mostly hating him for the conservatorship, but I think at first he was just trying to be like any father," the teen explained.
