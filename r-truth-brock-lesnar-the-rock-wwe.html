I had no promo, they gave me nothing. I'm like 'what's the promo? What am I supposed to say?'</p><p>And Paul is like 'Well, we have a bet going on. We don't want Brock to know what you're about to say. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We want you to make Brock laugh</a>.' I said 'Huh?!'</p><p>He said 'Truth, you're a funny a guy and we have a bet that you won't be able to make Brock laugh. I think you can, but they don't think you can. So just wing it, we're just going to wing it out there.</p><p></p><p>I said 'Paul, come on,' and he said 'The only thing you've got to say is you're going to throw him over the top rope, we're going to wing it out there, you're going to make Brock laugh.'</p><p>Once Brock came in I'm like... 'Damn, I think we should tell Brock what we're going to say, you know [laughs]. It's Brock Lesnar! Let's tell Brock. I don't want him to be surprised!' But Paul was like 'This is going to be great.'</p><p>I remember the moment we're in the ring and I'm going on and on, making stuff up in my head and going on and on, and I saw when Brock looked at me with that look of 'what the hell is he talking about?' because I'm just babbling.</p><p>I knew right then I had him. I did all I could to hold myself from laughing when I saw Brock bust out laughing because of Paul Heyman's facial expression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/02/truth.jpg><p>The magic just went on man, it kept going on. And after that segment was over, we're in the back and Brock was still laughing.</p><p>He said 'Bro, we got to do something together. There's something there. I don't know what it is, but there's something there.'</p><p>And we left it there. I know that's something we can always go back and pick up. But that is one of the highest moments in my career right there.</p><h4>On Brock Lesnar saying he wants to work with him...</h4><p>Not even to mention he's a cool dude backstage. To have Brock Lesnar say he wants to work with me, it was very appreciative to my soul, to my ego, to my career, to the time I've spent in the business, to everything I've done... Brock pretty much gave it a hug.</p><p>Imagine Brock giving your confidence a hug, man [laughs].</p><h4>On working with The Rock at Survivor Series 2011...</h4><p>Back when I was K-Kwik and The Rock was there, I think I did maybe one Royal Rumble with Rock. And that was the first time we physically did something.</p><p>Coming back around to where it was me and Miz versus Rock and [John] Cena, that was the first time ever, throughout my career that we physically worked together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/K-kwik.jpg><p>We've always been cool. I remember back in the Attitude Era when The Rock was doing music with Wyclef Jean and he'd ask me 'hey, do you think I'm doing too much? You think I shouldn't be rappin'?' I said 'Bro, do it!'</p><p>We were always cool. But he reached a whole different height once the Attitude Era was done. For it to come back full circle and to be in the ring with him [was great].</p><p>I remember when me and Miz, we didn't say nothing to each other walking through the hallway on the way to gorilla.&nbsp; We got in the ring, the smoke cleared and we could see Madison Square Garden was sold out. Packed out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/Truth1.jpg><p>We looked across the ring and there was Rock and Cena. We looked at each other and just smiled and right there we gave each other a dap and a hug. We both knew what that meant right there.</p><h4>After the match with Cena and Rock...</h4><p>Everybody was high-fiving - no egos around! No egos at all, man. It was all gratitude, humbleness, respect, appreciation - we were all a team at the time, man.</p><p>To me, that was one of the highest pinnacles of my career. Just one of the best fulfilled moments where I can pat myself on the back and say I did it.</p><p><strong>Catch R-Truth every Monday night on RAW on BT Sport</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/Rockmiztruth.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraK%2BimsC1uMinnmhvZW1%2FdYOOq2StqqWptW6u0aiapGWcmsCvrdFmq6GdXae8pLeMsK6eZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./americas-got-talent-champions-where-they-are-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here Are All The Champions Of America's Got Talent And What They're Doing Now">&larr;
