The actor separated from his first wife following infidelity accusations, and his second wife claimed the actor once told her that she was "lucky he didn't kill her."</p><p class=dh>American acclaimed actor and comedian Bill Murray is famous for his achievements and deadpan delivery. Although he has a wonderful success story, his love life took a different turn.</p><p class=dh>Over the years, Murray, who rose to prominence in the '70s, has been married twice, but his marriages endured difficulties ranging from an extramarital affair to a murderous claim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/58c23065ddbb0203ed1cffa83ef8789d1588911576231888.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray poses backstage at the GQ Men of the year Award 2016 on November 10, 2016 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MURRAY'S RELATIONSHIP TIMELINE</strong></p><p class=dh>Murray became a recognizable figure during "Saturday Night Live," and his performance on the show earned him his first Emmy Award. Over the years, his mastery in show business has made him the recipient of different awards, including the Golden Globe and the British Academy Film Award.</p><p class=dh>Murray decided he was ready to become a family man when he married his first wife Margaret Kelly during the filming of "Stripes" on January 25, 1981.</p><p class=dh>They had a similar ceremony in Chicago to honor their families, and throughout their marriage, the couple welcomed two sons, Homer and Luke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/acea77a5268d147441c2982b6c32db69706061561759305.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray attends the American Film Institute's 46th Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to George Clooney on June 7, 2018 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>However, things didn't go smoothly for the couple during their time as husband and wife because Murray was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.baltimoresun.com/la-et-billmurraydivorce-29may29-story.html>having an affair</a> with Jennifer Butler while still married Kelly. The couple divorced in 1996, and Murray later tied the knot with his mistress.</p><p class=dh>The "Meatballs" actor and Butler wed in 1997 and have four sons together, one of whom was born before his divorce from Kelly was finalized. But just like his first marriage, their love gradually ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/43c17a2d7ba1100f742f02085d5a18a311242401572625856.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray attends TimesTalks Presents event in New York City on June 29, 2017 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Butler filed for divorce after nearly 11-years together on May 12, 2008, with different ugly claims. The entertainer's wife tagged him as an abusive husband and a marijuana and alcohol addict.</p><p class=dh>However, the complaint alleged Murray physically assaulted his wife and threatened to kill her failed to sight instances of Murray's marijuana and alcohol use. The actor's attorney did not comment on Butler's claims, but he did say Murray was "deeply saddened" by the split.</p><p class=dh>But Butler was determined to end the relationship, and she applied for a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1022824/Bill-Murray-branded-sex-drug-addict-wife-years-files-divorce.html>restraining order</a> against the Hollywood star and claimed the actor said she was "lucky he didn't kill her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/93dc8b90a2d3175b3bb61cb47baf358f956371579867283.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray at Rome Film Fest 2019 on October 19th, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>According to Butler's claims, she and her children, Caleb, Jackson, Cooper, and Lincoln, were forced to leave their Â£2million home in Charleston because of their dad's behavior.</p><p class=dh>The restraining order aims at restricting Murray from "interfering with, intimidating, or making abusive or threatening phone calls" to Butler or the children. But, she offered proper visitation for the actor so long as he behaved appropriately.</p><p class=dh>Butler, who described herself as a "devoted and faithful wife," further aimed to stop the actor from exposing the children to drugs or his romantic affairs. The couple's divorce became official on June 13, 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e7e5fd3a875e0ecb19b8b4d6fe1995f9753941579867779.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray attends the masterclass during the 14th Rome Film Festival on October 19, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE WOMEN MURRAY MARRIED</strong></p><p class=dh>Murray's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/186764/the-truth-about-bill-murrays-children/>first wife</a>, Kelly, was no stranger to the entertainment industry when she married the "Ghostbusters'' actor. She studied theater arts at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College before taking a job as a page at NBC.</p><p class=dh>According to news reports, she was a talented coordinator on "The Tonight Show" and "The Dick Cavett Show." She reportedly started a cabin-inspired home goods store and forged a career in residential real estate while still married to Murray.</p><p class=dh>The now 71-year-old actor reportedly met his second wife while filming 1988's "Scrooged." They remained a loving pair raising their four sons together until the relationship went down the drain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4f0b1de84d3914c4c740dcd449c63084.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray during the 3M Celebrity Challenge prior to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on February 5, 2020 in Pebble Beach, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEET MURRAY'S CHILDREN</strong></p><p class=dh>However, although the Hollywood movie star was unlucky in his marriages, he shared a relatively close bond with all his children, and they all have successful careers. Murray's first child with Kelly, Luke, is an assistant men's basketball coach at the University of Louisville in Kentucky.</p><p class=dh>His second son, Homer, owns a popular restaurant in Brooklyn called 21 Greenpoint, but the actor's kids with Butler maintain private lives. Jackson has made a few appearances on social media, and Cooper played a small part in "Moonrise Kingdom." Lincoln and Caleb are well away from the spotlight.</p><p class=dh>Sadly, Butler, a famous face in the world of costume design, is no longer alive to watch her sons attain success after gaining full custody. A Twitter update <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/postandcourier/status/1354428953994391553>confirmed</a> she died on January 19, 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e4ef44263bb0501ead92b0f07419bb29.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Murray during the 14th Rome Film Festival on October 17, 2019 in Rome, Italy | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MURRAY IN RECENT TIMES</strong></p><p class=dh>After Murray's divorce from Butler, which gave her full custody of their kids as well as homes in California and South Carolina, it appeared the actor might no longer be interested in tying the knot.</p><p class=dh>Although the actor seemed happy with his single state, he once admitted feeling lonely many times in his life especially following a loss. During an interview, while speaking about the loneliness he experienced after his mother died, Murray <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/oct/22/features.weekend>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"There is also that little-discussed subject -- loneliness. That is a great taboo, isn't it? No one really wants to admit they are lonely[...]. But I have felt lonely many times in my life."</p><p class=dh>But it is unclear if he experienced any form of loneliness after Butler passed away as he has been very open about being happy with his single life. Once speaking in an interview, the Hollywood star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2014/10/10/Bill-Murray-says-he-is-single-but-not-lonely/2591412954407/>said</a>, "I have kids that I'm responsible for. I don't think I'm lonely."</p><p class=dh>The 71-year-old movie icon further admitted it would be nice having a date on special occasions, but he was working on other things that he needed doing. When asked what those things were, Murray said he was working on "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/10/bill-murray-girlfriend>self-development</a>."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Murray</a> also stole the show at an American's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-murray-marriage-speech-2014-5?r=US&IR=T">bachelor party</a> with his love and relationship theory. The actor, who resides in Charleston, South Carolina, was at a gathering filled with a male audience when a person spontaneously invited him to say something to the soon-to-be groom.</p><p class=dh>He said that Bachelor parties aren't for the grooms but the unmarried. His statement drew a lot of laughter from other guests, but that wasn't all he said.</p><p class=dh>A <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fx6exbiWhw">YouTube clip</a> also features the actor advising what to do with a girl one loves. He explained that lovers should travel around the world and when the vacation ends, they should get married if they are still in love.</p><p class=dh>Although the "Lost in Translation" actor's statement also got people laughing, it seemed his words came from years of experience in different relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtva2pobnqzu8KksGalkae%2Fqq3GnmSboZyheq7B0auYsqtdZ7uledainZ5lk6Gub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joseph-gordon-levitt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joseph Gordon-Levitt">&larr;
