But, recently, she was taken aback when the game show's fans inundated her with X-rated requests.</p><p>Anji Nyquist is a social media coordinator from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who earned her degree in Media Studies and Communication from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 2012. She admitted to being blindsided by ‘Jeopardy!’ viewers — given that most of the audience members are erudite quiz enthusiasts. Nyquist became the center of attention on the gameshow due to her way of speaking which gave fans a reason to mock her. However, besides being roasted, Nyquist was shocked when she also received X-rated requests, including creating an OnlyFans account. Anji emphasized in a post-show interview that ‘Jeopardy!’ is "about your brain and your performance in this scenario. It was flattering, though, because who likes seeing themselves on TV ever? It was not what I was expecting, that's for sure."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘La Brea’ Season 3 | Date, plot, cast, director and is NBC's sci-fi series worth watching</a></p><h2 class=split>What happened to Anji Nyquist?</h2><p>Anji, a social media coordinator from Minnesota, achieved a surprising victory on the recent episode of ‘Jeopardy!’. She surpassed the other contestants by correctly answering the Final Jeopardy clue, which referred to, “Nicknamed 'the kingdom in the sky,' this landlocked nation is the only country in the world to lie entirely above 4,000 feet”. Anji's unexpected win left her shocked but delighted. She was the only one to remember the country's name, ‘Lesotho’, garnering $800 and a priceless reaction after being declared as winner. Despite initially doubting her chances, she emerged victorious in a thrilling turn of events during Final Jeopardy.</p><p>Anji in an interview, said, "Amazing, I was as shocked as I looked. I was not expecting to win. I had a good game [Anji got 20 correct responses], but I had just turned to [rival contestant] Aubrey [Gillerman] and said, ‘I’m not gonna win this one,’ and he said something so kind, like, ‘You never know!’ And all of a sudden, Final Jeopardy happens, and I did win; it was crazy," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a> reported.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘Echo’ | Date, plot, cast, director and is the Marvel series worth watching</a></p><p>Anji's memorable moment continued to captivate audiences as she revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Ken Jennings</a> that her cat is named NAZ REID, paying tribute to the underrated Timberwolves player. Anji shared, “The whole Naz Reid thing blew up. That’s been the most fun part of this”. This revelation gained widespread attention, especially since Naz Reid had recently signed a significant contract, generating considerable buzz during the week Anji's episode aired. She concluded, “If you're a Naz Reid fan, you're a Naz Reid fan”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7aa67f01-b5ce-4aa4-8f0b-98590f866aa5.jpeg><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who stars in Marvel's 'Echo'?

Instead of asking about her viral pet cat or her winnings, several people suggested she create an account on the adult subscription platform OnlyFans. While she found it flattering, Anji stated, “I did an 'ask me anything,' and there were a lot of people who asked, ‘Would you do an OnlyFans? It would be really popular." She has received DMs from random men, with some messages complimenting her appearance and labeling her as the "hottest contestant ever," which she found to be silly, “I mean, that's not my style, but it was flattering? You’re gonna get some nice people, and you’re gonna get some creeps. I have been getting DMs from random men. Most of it's just nice, ‘you’re so beautiful, you're the hottest contestant ever - which is so dumb”.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'Secrets of Polygamy' | Date, plot and is the docu-series on extreme polygamist groups worth watching</a></p><p><a href=#>Golden Globes 2024: Why is Kieran Culkin against 'Succession' spinoff?
