With that many movies being created over the years, some of them are bound to repeat themselves. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood</a> is notorious for creating remakes of other films, but there’s a difference between making a newer version of a film and just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ripping it off</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 TV Shows That Revolutionized A Genre (& 5 That Ripped Them Off)</a></span></p><p>Most of the time when filmmakers rip-off another film they change the characters, but the plot is almost exactly the same. It seems like&nbsp;many of these came from a company&nbsp;called The Asylum, but there are a few other companies that have as well. Let’s take a look at all of the rip-off movies that have been created in the past decade.</p><h2 id=bound-2015><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'Bound' (2015)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bound is a movie that might actually be better than the one it ripped-off. “Bound was a rip-off of Fifty Shades Of Grey with some minor changes. Here the lady named Michelle is the wealthy one, not the man she gets intimate with. Other themes, including the BDSM and dominant men, are quite similar,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>. Fifty Shades Of Grey was criticized a lot for basically just being a theatrical version of an adult film and not really having a plot. Bound seems to have a little bit more of a plot.</p><h2 id=atlantic-rim-2013><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'Atlantic Rim' (2013)</span></h2><p>Even though it looks like a spin-off of Pacific Rim, Atlantic Rim is actually a rip-off of it, but it’s not the worst imitation of it. “Just like in the Pacific Rim, giant robots are created to help fight monsters that are emerging from the ocean. In both films, the giant robots are piloted by skilled people,” according to ScreenRant. Atlantic Rim has more action in it than special effects and somehow it looks better that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Shows That Blatantly Ripped Off Power Rangers</a></span></p><h2 id=abraham-lincoln-vs-zombies-2012><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'Abraham Lincoln Vs. Zombies' (2012)</span></h2><p>This one is a complete rip-off of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter—it just replaces vampires with zombies. People love zombie movies, so this actually works better than the original movie. According to ScreenRant, “Both movies take place during the U.S. Civil War and re-imagines President Abraham Lincoln as a hunter of supernatural creatures. Although both movies have been criticized for plot, the rip-off has been praised for the acting of Bill Oberst Jr. as Lincoln and has a better approach to tone given its outrageous plot than the Blockbuster.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rise-of-the-zombies-2012><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Rise Of The Zombies' (2012)</span></h2><p>Rise Of The Zombies came out right before World War Z even though they ripped-off its plot. “The plot centers on a group of survivors who flee to Alcatraz Island after a deadly water-borne virus leads to a zombie outbreak in San Francisco,” according to ScreenRant. Both films are about a virus turning people into zombies and although World War Z is more popular, Rise Of The Zombies still received good reviews.</p><h2 id=the-final-level-escaping-rancala-2019><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'The Final Level: Escaping Rancala' (2019)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Final Level: Escaping Rancala is basically a remake of Jumanji: The Next Level, but it was released the same year. “The Final Level: Escaping Rancala revolves around an arcade manager who makes the shocking discovery that her brother was sucked into one of the games. In order to find him, she and her two friends decide to enter the game too,” according to ScreenRant. The only difference is that the characters willingly went into the game instead of being sucked into it. While Jumanji: The Next Level was a success, audiences loved the mockbuster version of it too.</p><h2 id=titanic-2-2010><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Titanic 2' (2010)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Someone tried to make a sequel to Titanic, but it definitely wasn’t James Cameron. It’s pretty much the same plot as the original without the romance and set in modern day times. “History threatens to repeat itself when a new luxury liner sets sail to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the original's doomed voyage,” according to Rotten Tomatoes. The film got horrible reviews, but until James Cameron makes a real sequel (if he ever does) this is the best we have.</p><h2 id=the-green-inferno-2013><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>'The Green Inferno' (2013)</span></h2><p>The Green Inferno is based on the 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust and is pretty much a rip-off of it. The plot is a little bit different, but it’s still about a tribe of cannibals and both films are really disturbing. According to IMDb, “A group of student activists travels to the Amazon to save the rainforest and soon discover that they are not alone, and that no good deed goes unpunished.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Horror Movies That Revolutionized The Genre (& 5 That Ripped Them Off)</a></span></p><h2 id=sharknado-2013><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Sharknado' (2013)</span></h2><p>Sharknado is one of those movies where it’s so bad that it’s good. Unlike it’s rip-off movie, Jaws, it was released on TV on the Syfy channel. “When a freak hurricane swamps Los Angeles, nature's deadliest killer rules sea, land, and air as thousands of sharks terrorize the waterlogged populace,” according to IMDb. It’s basically just a movie about sharks flying around in the sky, but it was really popular when it first came out.</p><h2 id=the-good-dinosaur-2015><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'The Good Dinosaur' (2015)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Good Dinosaur</a> is about a young caveman and a dinosaur who become friends, but the theme seems to be ripped-off from the DreamWorks movie, The Croods. “The Croods arrived in 2013, a good two years before The Good Dinosaur, but it didn’t stop Disney/Pixar from doing a caveman movie of their own after the lucrative success of their competitor’s film,” according to Coming Soon. Although it’s a sweet story, it’s one of the least successful Pixar movies and The Croods coming out right before it might be the reason why.</p><h2 id=the-hunger-games-2012><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>'The Hunger Games' (2012)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might be the most surprising one on our list. Even though it’s based on a book series, it seems this kind of movie has already been done before. “Not to burst the bubble of any hardcore fans of the Hunger Games trilogy, but this story had already been told. The Japanese film Battle Royale is set in a dystopian future where the government forces a group of teenagers from the same high school to battle against one another until there is a winner, in order to control them and prevent a revolution,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Cinema</a>. Even if it is a rip-off of another film, it’s still one of the most popular film series of all time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">25 Video Games That Completely Ripped Off Star Wars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXZe2qLPErKtmnpmhum6%2ByKlkqJ6WqHqwsoytn55lnJbAtXmQaWSynZGnwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-hiddleston-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-98557-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Hiddleston Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
