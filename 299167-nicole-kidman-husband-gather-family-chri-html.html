The couple looked thrilled to be spending time together as a family once more as they walked hand-in-hand.</p><p class=fh>Keith and Nicole's two daughters, Sunday Rose Kidman Urban and Faith Margaret Kidman Urban, accompanied their parents as they traveled to Sydney. They could be seen straggling along after their famous mom and dad. The pair of sisters are impressively already as tall as their mom.</p><p class=fh>Not only do the Kidman Urban sisters resemble their parents, but there has been <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/12/18/nicole-kidman-daughters-sunday-faith-sydney-photos-2/>speculation</a> that they may also take after their mother and go into acting. Sunday and Faith were selected as extras in Nicole's miniseries produced by HBO, "The Undoing."</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>Nicole has been traveling to see her mom more often since last year when Janelle started struggling with her health.</strong></h3><p class=fh>While in Sydney, the family stayed in their Sydney <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11550649/Actress-Nicole-Kidman-makes-surprise-visit-Sydney-Christmas.html>penthouse</a> â€” a luxurious home comprised of three different <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/homes/20220607142235/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-property-portfolio/>apartments</a> in the same building. Two apartments are next door to each other, which have been turned into one large apartment. The third is on a lower floor and serves as Nicole's office.</p><p><h2 class=jh><strong class=dh>Why Did Nicole and Keith Visit Her Mom?</strong></h2></p><p class=fh>Christmas is fast approaching, and Nicole and her husband have ensured they can spend the holiday with family. Merely a few hours after the couple was seen at the airport, they showed up at Nicole's mom's home in Sydney. Keith and Nicole could be seen walking up to the house while holding hands.</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>During the show, the country artist took out his phone and recorded a video message to his wife.</strong></h3><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Keith</a> and Nicole stopped to wave at passers-by and continued into Janelle Ann Kidman's house, carrying a large bag of Christmas goodies. Nicole has been traveling to see her mom more often since last year when Janelle started struggling with her health. The actress <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11550787/Nicole-Kidman-wastes-no-time-visiting-mum-touching-Sydney.html>commented</a>, saying spending time with her mom has been lovely:</p><p class=fh>"That is so beneficial right now, because she's so cognizant. She has every brain faculty available, so she hasn't lost anything. She hasn't lost any memory, which is fascinating, and she's extremely bright."</p><p class=fh>The "Moulin Rouge" star mentioned that she feels honored to have been spending so much time with her mom. Janelle has imparted so much wisdom to her in the last while, and she said seeing the world from her mom's perspective has taught her a lot about life.</p><p><h2 class=jh><strong class=dh>What Else Is the Couple Doing in Australia, and Would They Want More Kids?</strong></h2></p><p class=fh>While they were in Australia, Keith held a concert for his Australian fans while Nicole stayed home and looked after the kids. During the show, the country artist took out his phone and recorded a video message to his wife. He got the crowd to <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/stories/nicolekidman/2996302601503529596/>yell out</a>, "Hi, Nic!" and ended it with a kiss.</p><p class=fh>In response, Nicole posted the video message on her Instagram and said the video was a pleasant surprise. But staying with the kids is no problem for the actress. She has admitted that she loves being a mother, and she would have wanted more kids. She <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/12/18/nicole-kidman-daughters-sunday-faith-sydney-photos-2/>said</a> she "would've loved 10" kids, but wasn't "given that choice."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5251d7b03418625702dbcf32408c3d4f.png><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Keith Urban in Melbourne, 2022 | Source: instagram.com/nicolekidman</p><p class=fh>It seems the couple might only be sticking with the two daughters they have now. Nicole also shares two children with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise. The actress shared that she loves children because they say exactly what they want to. And she loves to see them bloom into adults. She <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/12/18/nicole-kidman-daughters-sunday-faith-sydney-photos-2/>opened up</a> about not having more kids:</p><p class=fh>"But that's OK. I get to mother other children. I have six nieces and nephews and I'm godmother to 12. I love mothering, I love kids and what they say."</p><p class=fh>Luckily, <a class="Ed a" href=#>Nicole</a> has a huge family, and most of her relatives have kids, so she gets to help raise all her nieces and nephews. Besides her closest family, she is also the godmother of 12 children. What's more, she still has her two youngest daughters to look out for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcmlmbHqvtcKoo55lm56xrq3NZp%2Buq5KWu6V5xpqroZ2iYrOiucilsGabmKe2b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stephen-bechtel-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephen Bechtel Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
