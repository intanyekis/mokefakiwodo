In doing so, he will begin a new era for the company.</p><p>At a press conference, Hiroshi Tanahashi discussed his new role. NJPW <a href=#>shared a transcription</a> of his comments and the subsequent question-and-answer session with the media.</p><p>“I always carried a dream and ambition to be President as well as an active wrestler,” Hiroshi Tanahashi said. “I’m happy to be able to make that happen. I’m grateful for all the kind words of support that I’ve gotten since my appointment. That’s also given me a lot of expectations that I have to live up to here on out.”</p><h2 id=h-hiroshi-tanahashi-wants-to-sell-out-the-tokyo-dome>Hiroshi Tanahashi Wants To Sell Out The Tokyo Dome</h2><p>As for his goals, Hiroshi Tanahashi named selling out the Tokyo Dome and having more title outside of major cities as key objectives.</p><p>“I have some key goals that I would like to meet in my time as the President,” Tanahashi said. “First of all, I want to sell out the Tokyo Dome. This has always been the goal for me. For a wrestler to walk down the ramp in front of a sold-out Tokyo Dome crowd is something to be proud of forever, and something that will live with you for the rest of your career, as well as something the fans themselves will carry with them for a long time to come.</p><p>“I also plan on having more title matches outside of major cities. In the 2000s when I worked with out promotion and sales staff, the goal at first was to put 500 people in the buildings, and then 1000 and then on and on. I feel that selling out the Tokyo Dome only becomes possible when the towns all around Japan are sold out as well. I want to unite all of Japan’s wrestling fans in their passion and carry that to the Tokyo Dome.”</p><p>Additionally, Tanahashi expressed his intent to increase NJPW’s work with sponsors. He noted that his status as an active wrestler would be beneficial in that regard.</p><h2 id=h-hiroshi-tanahashi-on-his-goals>Hiroshi Tanahashi On His Goals</h2><p>Hiroshi Tanahashi was asked about his goals in his new role. He responded by explaining that he wants to create memories for fans.</p><p>“It’s tough, but I think the key thing is to consider how the fans want to experience NJPW,” Hiroshi Tanahashi said. “I remember as a fan going to shows and having dinner or sitting with a couple of beers after just wanting to talk about the show I’d seen and how exciting things were. Those conversations are some of my favorite memories. So I think the key is how we create those memories and how we have fans leaving the buildings happy.”</p><p>Hiroshi Tanahashi also made it clear that he intends to remain on the road with NJPW. He stated that he will be in the office when the company is in Tokyo. He also said that there is plenty he still wants to accomplish as a wrestler, and he will perform in both positions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaG9xZGK1qr7OrJ%2BiZaSWu6K0wKyfomWRmbGzsdKsnKxlnprEbr7OpZxmmaNiu6u81manq52jnrGmutM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-needs-to-sue-sam-for-custody.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason needs to sue Sam for custody - General Hospital">&larr;
