It makes sense, then, that she was the one to inherit his favorite house, Garden Lodge, a neo-Georgian, impressive mansion in Kensington, London.

She spent decades by Freddie Mercury's side, as his girlfriend for a few years, and as his best friend for the rest of his life. The memories, at a certain point, seem to have gotten too intense, and she methodically emptied the house, selling, moving, or giving away the singer's things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Austin said in a statement</a>. "It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, Iâ€™m transported back to the first time we viewed it."</strong></p><p>As hard as it will be to get rid of it, she knows it will be the perfect home for whoever gets to live there next. <strong>"Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist's house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person."</strong></p><h2 id=what-freddie-mercury-said-about-his-famous-garden-lodge>What Freddie Mercury Said About His Famous Garden Lodge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/freddie-mercury-on-stage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, Freddie Mercury shared Mary Austin's appreciation of the beautiful house he ended up buying.

He adored ballet, modern art, and opera, and the way his house was decorated certainly reflected that.</strong> He collected expensive artwork and various one-of-a-kind items, some of which have already been sold, as Mary Austin explained, and the house was the perfect reflection of his personality.</p><p>The sale of the house will certainly be a bittersweet process for everyone who knew and loved the iconic singer, including his Queen bandmates, but it's healthy for Mary Austin to close this chapter of her life with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq52UmbamecyeqZytoq56rbvNoKuipZVir6a%2F02adq6GVo7FuwM5mqp6knGK2pLvNoppmpJ%2BjsbC6jKaYp6uZpLtuw8eeqZ5lmJp6pbXEnWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heather-cairns-obituary-death-a-loving-farewell-to-heather-cairns.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heather Cairns Obituary, Death, A Loving Farewell to Heather Cairns">&larr;
