Starring the likes of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a></strong>, Victoria Justice, Daniella Monet, and many more, the four-season series centers around an aspiring singer as she navigates through the ups and downs of making her mark in the Hollywood Arts performing high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande Celebrates The 10 Year Anniversary Of 'Victorious'</a></span></p><p>The show itself ended eight years ago and amassed a spin-off, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam & Cat</a>, & <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">four Emmy nominations</a>. Since then, its stars have been venturing into many things from scoring millions of album sales to securing roles in some big titles.</p><p><strong>Updated on October 26, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong>Victorious aired for 4 seasons on Nickelodeon, giving rise to most of its cast. Following its premiere in 2010, it was clear that the cast, made up of Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Daniella Monet, and Elizabeth Gillies, to name a few, was full of talent! Gillies went on to appear in the hit series, Dynasty, amassing a net worth of $4 million, while Monet is taking a backseat to the spotlight to focus on motherhood. While she wasn't the star of the show, Ariana Grande, who played Cat Valentine, takes the cake on highest Victorious net worth with $200 million sitting in the bank. Ari recently earned an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 - $25 million from The Voice</a>, which certainly did wonders for her ever-growing net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leon-thomas-iii---net-worth-600-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Leon Thomas III - Net Worth $600,000</span></h2><p>Despite being one of the most recognizable faces of the show, Leon Thomas III decided to venture more into music than acting after Victorious' cancellation. The R&B singer is now a part of The Rascals, a production duo that sought massive success in 2014 by producing Toni Braxton and Babyface's Grammy-winning album, Love, Marriage & Divorce. The album itself was crowned the Best R&B Album of the Year by the Academy. The star recently earned himself three writing credits on none other than Drake's newest album, Certified Lover Boy, which has certainly contributed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his $600,000 net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avan-jogia---net-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Avan Jogia - Net Worth $1 million</span></h2><p>After departing Nickelodeon, Avan Jogia continued to add more titles to his impressive acting resume. The Canadian actor also starred in ABC's Twisted family drama, as well as Ghost Wars on Syfy. In addition to this, during his time with Nickelodeon, Jogia co-founded Straight But Not Narrow, an online organization that supports LGBT youths to stand up for themselves. Luckily for Avan, his time in the limelight has paid well, considering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor is worth $1 million.</a></p><h2 id=michael-eric-reid---net-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Michael Eric Reid - Net Worth $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having a massive boost in Victorious, Michael Eric Reid seems to struggle to land himself some big-dollar roles. According to his IMDb page, most of his recent works are only short cameos in small series, with the latest, an episode on Paradise City released this year. However, it's still enough to secure him an approximate<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $1 million net worth</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Avan Jogia Doesn’t Remember Filming ‘Victorious’</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-bennett---net-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matt Bennett - Net Worth $1 million</span></h2><p>According to CNW, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Bennett is worth $1 million</a>. After appearing in small commercials, the New York actor landed his big foray with Victorious and also in 2010 with The Virginity Hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the show ended, Bennett decided to focus on his musical career and released his debut album, Terminal Cases, in 2016. He also appeared in Ariana Grande's 'Thank U, Next" music video.</p><h2 id=daniella-monet---net-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Daniella Monet - Net Worth $3 million</span></h2><p>Before Victorious, Daniella Monet was already a well-renowned name in Nickelodeon thanks to her works on Zoey 101 from 2006 to 2007. In addition to acting, the proud mother of two also hosted the sketch-comedy series, AwesomenessTV from 2013 to 2015 and Paradise Run from 2016 to 2018. This past February, the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed her second child</a> with her fiance, Andrew Gardner. Luckily for Daniella, her time under the spotlight has allowed her to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $3 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-gillies---net-worth-4-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Elizabeth Gillies - Net Worth $4 million</span></h2><p>After Victorious, Elizabeth Gillies continued to take her career to new heights. The former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway actress</a> proved she's versatile by venturing into other genres, like horror-thriller and road comedy. Animal (2014), Vacation (2015), Dynasty (2017), and Arizona (2018) are some of the actress's essential works that amassed her an approximate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million in net worth.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Victorious' Cast Members Comment On Liz Gillies' Recent Wedding Pics, But Where's Avan Jogia?</a></span></p><h2 id=eric-lange---net-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eric Lange - Net Worth $10 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eric Lange elevated his place in the industry by working on the likes of Narcos, Once Upon A Time, Grey's Anatomy, and Lost. It may come as a surprise for many because, despite his minimum screentime on Victorious, the Ohio actor joined the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top-three highest-net worth earners</a> from the show, amassing an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $10 million.</a></p><h2 id=victoria-justice---net-worth-12-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Victoria Justice - Net Worth $12 million</span></h2><p>Victoria Justice rose to fame with Victorious, but she didn't stop there. In fact, the leading actress also contributed to the show's soundtrack album with her angelic voice. The former Zoey 101 actress is now signed to Sony and Columbia and is eyeing a lot of possible upcoming projects on her horizon. Her latest romance drama, Trust, was released this year. Victoria, who was the star of the series, has found herself sitting on a very comfy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million net worth.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande---net-worth-200-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ariana Grande - Net Worth $200 million</span></h2><p>The last, and undoubtedly the most successful Victorious alum, is Ariana Grande. After her successful foray with Victorious and its spinoff, Grande continued to make a name for herself in the music industry by releasing back-to-back classic pop albums in the 2010s.</p><p>Her latest album, Positions, was released in 2020, and she has her eyes on the prize. The star recently gained millions after signing onto The Voice as a judge, earning an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated $25 million</a>, which brings her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to a whopping $200 million.</a> With millions to her name, it's no surprise that Ari has donated $5 million for free therapy in honor of World Mental Health Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Secrets Behind Nickelodeon's Victorious</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWaumZjBsL7IqKysZaKWu6yxw2aZsmWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./boxer-sherif-lawal-dead-at-29-after-collapsing-during-pro-debut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boxer Sherif Lawal Dead at 29 After Collapsing During Pro Debut">&larr;
