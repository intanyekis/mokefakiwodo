The majority of fans are curious about his net worth, mainly to determine his position among the wealthiest artists in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sean Kingston, whose real name is Кіѕеаn Аndеrѕоn, was born on 3rd February 1990 in Miami. He is a Jamaican-American rapper, songwriter, and singer; his family moved to Jamaica when he was a kid, but they later moved back to the states.</p><p>When Sean's career initially launched via YouTube, fans expected big things. But over the past few years, Kingston has seemed to fade from view. So where is he now, and what exactly is his net worth?</p><h2 id=sean-kingston-39-s-music-career-earned-him-millions>Sean Kingston's Music Career Earned Him Millions</h2><p>Kingston’s childhood may have been challenging owing to the fact that he was once jailed at eleven years old for breaking and entering. Consequently, it is believed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spent about twenty-one days in prison</a>. His mother had also been charged with identity fraud, and as she spent some time in jail, Kingston lived in a car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kingston was still determined to pursue his music career despite going through such tough times.</p><h2 id=sean-kingston-started-out-on-youtube>Sean Kingston Started Out On YouTube</h2><p>Kingston’s music career began on social media sites since he would <a href=#>release his music video on platforms like YouTube, like many other now-successful artists</a>. He wrote hooks and rhymes alongside poetry and posted them to enjoy. Today, fans may not consider Sean's channel <a href=#>one of the most 'amazing,'</a> but it did get him noticed.</p><p>Kingston's big break came when Тоmmу Rоtеm listened to his music and became interested in him. Tommy must have noticed great potential in Kingston because he ensured that the signer got a contract with Sony and Beluga Heights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This contract may have led to his single ‘Beautiful Girls’, which was first heard in 2007 and performed tremendously. It became a great hit and topped Billboard Hot 100, propelling it into the top rank of music charts. The single had numerous fans in countries such as Spain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and England.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What's With The 'Sean Kingston Dead' Rumors? Here's What He's Doing Today</a></span></p><p>The huge success of Sean Kingston’s first single created a path towards wealth accumulation since his career propelled, causing him to win certain awards and nominations. He would feature in musical concerts’ opening acts for some of the most famous artists like Beyonce, Gwen Stefani, and Kelly Clarkson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there's also the smash hit 'Baby' that <a href=#>Kingston collaborated on with then-industry newbie Justin Beiber</a>.</p><p>After two years, Kingston released more studio albums such as ‘Tomorrow’, ‘Back to Life,’ and ‘Kingston’. As his musical career progressed he worked with other successful artists such as Vybz Cartel, Flo Rida, Mel B, and Akon, among others.</p><p>As a result of his success, he received various awards and was nominated for several more.</p><h2 id=what-is-sean-kingston-39-s-net-worth>What Is Sean Kingston's Net Worth?</h2><p>Sean Kingston has always been a hardworking individual since his teenage years. So it is estimated that he could be worth about two million dollars. His primary source of income has been his music career, considering that he has collaborated with numerous other talented and famous singers, as mentioned above.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, Kingston has always experimented with his music, which led him to be among the greatest hip-hop artists. He did not believe in focusing on one genre of music. So he explored others and hence created reggae and reggae fusion music and R&B.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Has Sean Kingston Been Up To Since The Release Of 'Eenie Meenie'?</a></span></p><p>Successfully exploring these music genres earned him a lot of fans that would show up in great numbers during roadshows and concerts, which offered a great chance to reach bigger audiences and earn handsomely. He is known to attract more followers due to his humble nature and down-to-earth persona.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being in the music industry, Kingston has also explored the acting industry, contributing immensely to his net worth. He has had numerous television appearances in Suite Life on Deck and Yo Gabba Gabba.</p><p>Although Kingston is said to be a millionaire, many people question the authenticity of such conclusions because the singer has had numerous cases of money problems. For instance, the artist is said to have disclosed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had money problems in March of 2014</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="50 Cent Jokes About Being Bankrupt To Avoid Biden's Tax Hike">50 Cent Jokes About Being Bankrupt To Avoid Biden's Tax Hike</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He disclosed this information after his Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV was repossessed following a three-month delay in making payments. Another incident occurred about a week later when another of his luxurious cars, a Bentley, was also repossessed outside famous Hollywood hotels.</p><p>Another incident occurred in the same year on 28th July when his Lamborghini was repossessed on a street near Hollywood and Vine. Kingston claimed that he had not made payments for six months. His money problems progressed, and most involved jewelry and jewelers.</p><p>Several jewelers complained that Kingston had failed to make payments for multiple items he had ordered. One of such jewelers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit and won</a>, as the judge ordered Kingston to pay over three hundred thousand dollars. However, it is alleged that the signer only put down a one thousand dollar deposit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another jeweler sued Kingston for about $356,000 in damages for failure to make payments in 2015. These cases became quite alarming when the singer reported being kidnapped and threatened. Despite such occurrences, there were more similar accusations in the following years, such as in 2018.</p><p>With such a track record of failure to make payments for jewelry and repossession of cars, it's fair if fans question his true net worth, though it's reportedly around the $2 million mark.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Here's How MC Hammer Went From Rap Star To Bankrupt">Here's How MC Hammer Went From Rap Star To Bankrupt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKemKdlm567qL%2FTqKWsZZ6awW7DzquroWViZX9zew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./blueface-reportedly-arrested-in-las-vegas-due-to-attempted-murder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blueface Reportedly Arrested In Las Vegas Due To Attempted Murder">&larr;
