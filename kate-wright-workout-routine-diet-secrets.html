She often wears skimpy dresses and sheer blouses. She also likes displaying her body with bikinis and posting pictures on social media. Her recent pics from her girls’ holiday in Ibiza are making everyone jealous of her enviable figure. Here we try to find out the workout regime&nbsp;and diet secrets that help her to achieve that amazing body. We also have a look at what motivates her to workout regularly and who’s her fitness motivation these days.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>The workout of The Only Way is Essex (2010-Present) actress is very simple. She pushes herself to the limit by exercising for up to seven days a week when she can manage it. She also takes the help of a personal trainer for 4 days every week and on those days, she trains really hard. Going to the gym early mornings is her preferred workout routine as it sets her day off straight. Some of the exercises preferred by her are <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>squats</a> and weights and she was recently seen doing them.</p><figure id=attachment_53560 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53560 style=width:540px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kate Wright workout at a park in Essex on August 11, 2016</figure><h3><strong>Workout Motivation</strong></h3><p>The workout motivation of the ex-girlfriend of <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Dan Edgar</a> is that when she works out, she thinks straight and her body releases endorphins. These reasons motivate her to workout regularly. She also feels better after every workout so she sticks to them. Doing workouts regularly also helps her during tough phases of life. It recently helped her to stay positive despite a bad breakup, reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Look</a>.</p><figure id=attachment_53557 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53557 style=width:463px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kate Wright in bikini</figure><h3><strong>Workout Gear</strong></h3><p>Kate is often spotted working out when she is outside. She was recently spotted in the cool workout gear of a workout trouser and a top that was accompanied by a pair of flip flops rather than trainers. She looked extremely comfortable in that gear.</p><h3><strong>Current Workout</strong> <strong>Motivation</strong></h3><p>The current workout motivation of the reality star seems to be achieving the body like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Teyana Taylor</a>’s look in the Fade video. She even listens to that song while working out for getting more motivation.</p><figure id=attachment_53556 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53556 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kate Wright and Danielle Armstrong working out at a park in Essex</figure><h3><strong>Diet Secrets</strong></h3><p>The diet secrets of the diva are very simple too. She does not believe in dieting. She likes eating healthily and enjoys&nbsp;eating bad&nbsp;foods as well. For her, it’s all about balancing the two desires. Her funda is to eat healthily at least 5 days a week so that she can allow herself to enjoy a takeaway at weekends. The beautiful woman also adds that when she works out, she pushes herself to the limit so that if she indulges in junk&nbsp;food during the weekend, she doesn’t feel too bad about it.</p><figure id=attachment_53558 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53558 style=width:600px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kate Wright on Twitter after a workout session promoting Protein World</figure><h3><strong>Diet Indulgence</strong></h3><p>The lovely lady recently revealed on social media that she is a fan of chip butties. She also indicated that she can’t have enough of them.</p><h3><strong>Relying on Supplements</strong></h3><p>The sister of Mike Hassini has openly admitted in the past that she is a fan of protein blends, capsules,&nbsp;and collections offered by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Protein World</a>.</p><h3><strong>Dedication to Fitness</strong></h3><p>The TV personality is so dedicated to fitness that when she had an operation some time back, she couldn’t wait to get back to the gym. Taking to the social media, she explained that it takes a lot for her to not train on any given day. Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to train for 2 days after her operation. So when she got back to workouts, she felt great. Working out made her feel 100 times better.</p><figure id=attachment_53559 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53559 style=width:532px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kate Wright preparing porridge as a workout snack</figure><p>The gorgeous actress also confessed that training for her is not just about the way it makes her look. It’s also about the way it makes her feel. Training makes her feel that her mind is free and she loves that feeling.</p><p>Did you like the workout and diet secrets of Wright?
