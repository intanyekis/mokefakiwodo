It happened with Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted, and Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. This can lead to a lot of angry lead actors. Fortunately, most leading men and leading ladies don't let it get them down...at least they don't always show it if they do. However, there are some actors who really, really don't like sharing the spotlight and it leads to some pretty nasty feuds behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been some famous actor vs. director feuds in the history of Hollywood as the director does their best to control and use their paintbrush as they want while the actor objects to the idea of being a paintbrush and grapples for creative control. Then there are some feuds that are between actors and their costars. Sometimes they don't like sharing the spotlight with each other. Sometimes one actor is jealous of the other's talent or attractiveness. Sometimes it can be as simple as both actors being&nbsp;difficult to work which makes them butt heads with each other.</p><p>One thing they all have in common? They each hate each other and some have vowed to never work with the other again.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-vs-tyrese-2-furious>Dwayne Johnson Vs. Tyrese: 2 Furious</h2><p>It's hard to believe that anyone wouldn't be able to get along with one of the most amiable leading men in Hollywood but Tyrese definitely found a way. Dwayne Johnson is one of Hollywood's biggest stars--but he played second fiddle to Vin Diesel in the Fast and Furious franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyrese first appeared in 2 Fast 2 Furious&nbsp;back in 2003 so it makes sense that he wasn't very happy when his costar Dwayne Johnson would be getting his very own Fast and Furious spin-off movie when he only first appeared in the franchise in 2011 in Fast Five. Because of the production and eventual release of the spin-off, Fast and Furious 9&nbsp;won't be released until 2020 and Tyrese wasn't happy about that. Johnson also had some choice words to say about Tyrese as well but he doesn't seem nearly as angry considering he's going to have his own movie.</p><h2 id=bette-davis-vs-joan-crawford-feud>Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford: Feud</h2><p>One of the most infamous feuds in Hollywood history was made relevant again thanks to FX's Feud: Bette and Joan&nbsp;which premiered in 2017. Not only did Bette Davis and Joan Crawford hate each other but they actually loved to hate each other.&nbsp;When Crawford's career first began, she was an "It-Girl" while Davis was known for her true acting talent.&nbsp;After,&nbsp;Crawford stole Davis' man and won an Oscar, the All About Eve star never missed the chance to bad-mouth Crawford and call her untalented.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although&nbsp;she too had won an Oscar, Crawford knew that Bette was, in fact, the better actress and she resented her for it. The two truly turned against each other in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane in which Crawford played a victimized sister who is tormented by Davis' character, Jane. While Crawford got to play the victim, Davis got the meatier role as the cruel and conniving sister. Though Crawford's role wasn't substantial enough for even the best actress in the world to do anything with, she still resented Davis for being nominated for an Oscar for her performance. The two always hated each other but they also had a level of respect for each other at the same time.</p><h2 id=ashley-tisdale-vs-lucas-grabeel-bop-to-the-top>Ashley Tisdale vs. Lucas Grabeel: Bop to the Top</h2><p>Now that we've looked at Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, let's move on to two other iconic Hollywood legends...okay, not exactly. Though it won't go down in the history books, High School Musical was a hugely successful franchise in its day and&nbsp;the roles of Sharpay and Ryan turned two actors against each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lucas Grabeel has said that his costar Ashley Tisdale seemed to go for the Daniel Day Lewis approach of method acting because she&nbsp;stayed in character as Sharpay all day, every day. According to Grabeel, the two actually hated each other during the filming of HSM&nbsp;but after it wrapped, the two went on to become good friends. Maybe she learned to&nbsp;stop acting like an entitled drama queen at some point between the filming of High School Musical and High School Musical 2.</p><h2 id=bill-murray-vs-chevy-chase-saturday-night-feud>Bill Murray vs. Chevy Chase: Saturday Night Feud</h2><p>Chevy Chase has long been known for being difficult to work with in Hollywood ever since he first rose to fame from appearing in Saturday Night Live. However, Chase left SNL because he thought he was too famous for it now and he deserved to be starring in his own movies. Murray took his place on the show and he eventually became a bigger star than Chase ever was or ever would be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though it was their roles on SNL that originally turned them against each other, their roles in Caddyshack didn't help either. Murray was only on set for six days as he was only supposed to be a small cameo in the film but after he&nbsp;ad-libbed some of his iconic lines, including his Dalai Lama speech, he&nbsp;became the star of the show, completely eclipsing Chase. The two hated each other so much that they only have one scene together and the tension&nbsp;in the air was so thick, you could cut it with a knife.</p><h2 id=ryan-gosling-vs-rachel-mcadams-he-tried-to-get-her-fired>Ryan Gosling vs. Rachel McAdams: He Tried to Get Her Fired</h2><p>Though it's since become one of the most beloved romances in film history and launched both of its leads into stardom, the history of The Notebook is dicey. First of all, Ryan Gosling was only cast as the lead because the director, Nick Cassavetes, wanted an actor who was a little scruff and not remarkably&nbsp;good-looking--seriously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cassavetes loved McAdams from the beginning but Gosling hated her so much that he actually asked him to&nbsp;bring in another actress to read off camera with him, saying,&nbsp;“I can’t. I can’t do it with her. I’m just not getting anything from this.” The director took his two actors into a room and after they&nbsp;screamed and yelled at each other for a bit, they agreed to keep working together. Gosling said later that he actually respected McAdams for standing up for herself. The two eventually dated for several years.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron-vs-tom-hardy-furious-feud>Charlize Theron vs. Tom Hardy: Furious Feud</h2><p>Mad Max: Fury Road is a gritty, action-packed thrill-ride that took its actors for quite a ride as well. There were rumours about the stars, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, having a rift between them and Zoe Kravitz confirmed that the two didn't get along at all...while also mentioning that they were in the desert for weeks and nobody was really getting along all the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Kravitz, the two just weren't "vibing" and Hardy confirmed that there was definitely some tension there. Theron said that after filming, she received a note from Hardy that read,&nbsp;"You are an absolute nightmare, BUT you are also f--ing awesome." It seems like they may not like each other but they definitely have respect for each other's talent.&nbsp;That being said, the fight scene between Max and Furiosa did look pretty realistic. Maybe it wasn't just acting?</p><h2 id=viola-davis-vs-jared-leto-almost-pepper-sprayed>Viola Davis vs. Jared Leto: Almost Pepper-Sprayed</h2><p>Let's be honest, Jared Leto as the Joker in Suicide Squad rubbed everyone the wrong way, not just Viola Davis. Leto made headlines every other week leading up to the premiere of Suicide Squad because he did something "in character" that was absurdly creepy&nbsp;and unnecessarily disturbing. He sent his cast members gifts that were not appreciated,&nbsp;which were very inappropriate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Davis who is much too professional to deal with&nbsp;Leto's shenanigans, put her foot down.&nbsp;In very poor taste, Leto sent Davis a box of bullets and the How to Get Away With Murder star said she almost pepper-sprayed him. It might have been a completely appropriate response. It turns out that the Joker was barely even in the movie and it received very poor reviews.</p><h2 id=jamie-foxx-vs-colin-ferrell-miami-vices>Jamie Foxx vs. Colin Ferrell: Miami Vices</h2><p>After actors win Oscars, they occasionally begin to have delusions of grandeur. This is what happened to Jamie Foxx after he won an Academy Award for Ray.&nbsp;Right after he won his award, he starred in Miami Vice alongside Colin Ferrell and the two did not get along.</p><p>Apparently Foxx felt that he was too good to appear in the movie and thought himself to be above his costar, especially considering he was being paid a lot more than Ferrell. It seemed that Ferrell didn't have a problem with the difference in compensation as much as he did with Foxx's arrogance during filming. The two often butted heads with each other and Foxx even got into spats with the director. The story goes that Foxx didn't want to leave the country during filming which caused the director to change the ending of the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=channing-tatum-vs-alex-pettyfer-bad-boys>Channing Tatum vs. Alex Pettyfer: Bad Boys</h2><p>According to Alex Pettyfer,&nbsp;"Channing Tatum does not like me.&nbsp;For many reasons. Many being my own fault." Pettyfer and Tatum starred in Magic Mike together and these two hunky dudes just did not get along. Pettyfer said that he believed that Tatum didn't like him from the start because he had invested his own money into Magic Mike and he saw casting Pettyfer as a risky move due to his bad boy reputation.</p><p>Tatum is&nbsp;a not only a huge star, he is also a smart businessman, and considering that Pettyfer was known for not being easy to work with, Tatum didn't like him. Pettyfer said that he felt at odds with the entire cast which is why he would go into the corner and listen to music with his headphones during takes which probably caused everyone to think that he thought he was too good for everyone. Apparently they couldn't work it out because Pettyfer did not appear in the sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-vs-terrence-howard-don-t-mess-with-iron-man>Robert Downey Jr. vs. Terrence Howard: Don't Mess With Iron Man</h2><p>Marvel became the franchise it is today thanks to one very important movie: Iron Man. Iron Man premiered in 2008 and it proved to Hollywood that Marvel Studios could make millions of dollars by making their own movies with their own intellectual property.</p><p>Terrence Howard appeared in the first instalment of the Iron Man series but he was replaced by Don Cheadle in the following films. It turns out that Howard was not happy that the star had gotten a huge pay raise while he was offered less money. According to Howard, it was Downey who caused him to have a pay-cut because he wanted Howard out of the movie. At the time, Howard took the bait and left the franchise completely which is why he was replaced.&nbsp;Considering how much money the actors in Marvel movies make now, it makes sense that he would be pissed off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dakota-johnson-vs-jamie-dornan-mr-grey-will-see-you-out>Dakota Johnson vs. Jamie Dornan: Mr. Grey Will See You Out</h2><p>It has long been said that Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan hate each&nbsp;other but how much truth is there to the claims? Though the two are supposed to be wildly in love in the Fifty Shades of Grey movies, the two seem to lack a certain amount of chemistry that is needed to convince us of this affection. Many believe that the two are at odds with each other due to the fact that they rarely even look at each other during interviews as if they can't even stand the sight of&nbsp;each other.</p><p>To be fair, the Fifty Shades series is a tragically embarrassing franchise to be stuck in and the two probably hate the movie and the characters more than they actually hate each other. Luckily for them, the series is over and we can all move on like it never even happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-vs-johnny-depp-clean-up-your-act>Angelina Jolie vs. Johnny Depp: Clean Up Your Act</h2><p>At the time The Tourist premiered, it would seem that Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, two of the biggest stars in the Hollywood, would&nbsp;have a lot of chemistry together...at least it seemed like it on paper. However, Jolie and Depp had a complete lack of chemistry due to several reasons. Jolie was mad at Depp for not cutting his hair, cleaning up, and losing weight while Depp was angry with Jolie for being too demanding and too full of herself.</p><p>Considering the two are experienced actors, you would never guess that they hated each other based on their roles in the movie. This is probably why many believe the rumor that Depp actually had something to do with Jolie's divorce from Brad Pitt. In reality, it's possible that the only person Jolie hates more than her ex-husband is her ex-costar, Johnny Depp.</p><h2 id=claire-danes-vs-leonardo-dicaprio-crossed-stars>Claire Danes vs. Leonardo DiCaprio: Crossed Stars</h2><p>In Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have so much chemistry that many of their fans still hope that they will, one day, end up together. However, in Romeo +&nbsp;Juliet it's a different story. Danes may have been six years younger than DiCaprio (she was 16 and he was 22), but she was definitely the most mature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the stories, the supposed star-crossed lovers did not get along. Danes was irritated with her costar because of his immaturity on set. Nowadays&nbsp;DiCaprio takes his roles so seriously that he slept in a real dear carcass on the set of The Revenant, but he didn't take things so seriously back in 1996. Since he was often goofing off and playing pranks, Danes hated working with him. DiCaprio, on the other hand, was irritated with her for taking things too seriously and being too full of herself.</p><h2 id=lucy-liu-vs-bill-murray-charlie-s-demons>Lucy Liu vs. Bill Murray: Charlie's Demons</h2><p>There are a lot of things wrong with the Charlie's Angels 2000 reboot and the feud between Bill Murray and Lucy Liu was one of them. While they were filming the movie, Murray actually said to Liu that she couldn't act and Liu was not happy about that at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, she probably wanted to lob off his head like her character&nbsp;does in Kill Bill but she resorted to getting him fired instead. It turns out that the director, McG, didn't like Murray very much either so it probably wasn't difficult to get him to replace him. Considering that Liu was&nbsp;one of the actual angels, Murray was booted out and replaced with Bernie Mac in the sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. As far as we know, Mac didn't complain about Liu's acting ability.</p><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-vs-kim-cattrall-friends-or-foes>Sarah Jessica Parker vs. Kim Cattrall: Friends or Foes</h2><p>The feud between Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall has been all over the news lately after Cattrall said that she had no interest in appearing in a third&nbsp;SATC&nbsp;movie. The two went on to bad-mouth each other in interviews, both calling each other out for one thing or another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cattrall, she was never truly accepted by SJP who formed a sort of "Mean Girls" group with Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis while Jones was often left out. Though it was Cattrall's character Samantha Jones who truly makes the show and movies worth watching, her salary was&nbsp;significantly lower than Parker's. Recently, Cattrall finally admitted that she didn't feel like she was ever really friends with her costars and SJP fired back at her for keeping the&nbsp;movie from happening. It turns out that Nixon is now running for governor of New York and doesn't have time to film a third movie anyway so it's all a moot point now, isn't it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6rrvVopxmqp%2BhsrR506GYrWWkqr%2BvscNmmJysn6fAbq3GmqCnq6RisqKvx2amraCVp3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bobby-jones-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bobby Jones Net Worth">&larr;
