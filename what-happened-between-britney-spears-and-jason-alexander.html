In addition, we'll discuss how Alexander felt about Spears in the recent years.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-and-jason-alexander-were-married-for-55-hours-after-a-trip-to-vegas>Britney Spears And Jason Alexander Were Married For 55-Hours After A Trip To Vegas</h2><p>Over the years, Jason Alexander's stance has changed on exactly what went down between himself and <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong> back when they married in the early 2000s. Ultimately, the marriage was annulled, following a brief marriage ceremony in Vegas. Back then, <a href=#>Alexander simply claimed that the two weren't ready to take the big leap.</a></p><p>"That's when all hell broke loose. We realized that what we did wasn't probably the right thing we should have done and wasn't the right way to go about it and that we needed to fix the problem...so that's when the annulment came in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Is Britney Spearsâ€™ Ex, Jason Allen Alexander Doing Now?</a></span></p><p>Years later however, Alexander's story started to change. This time around, Alexander blamed their relationship failure completely on Britney's family. According to Jason, he was forced to sign a contract and was given false hope by those close to the pop star. It would ultimately lead to Jason getting blocked out of the picture and being on the outs for good.</p><h2 id=jason-alexander-blamed-britney-spears-family-for-ruining-their-relationship>Jason Alexander Blamed Britney Spears' Family For Ruining Their Relationship</h2><p>Given Alexander's words, the end of his relationship to Spears took place due to manipulation by the family.</p><p>"The men in black swooped in, along with her mum and other family members, and they made us sign paperwork under duress to end our marriage. We didn't want to annul it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was tricked by her mum, dad and lawyers into signing the annulment. I was told our marriage could hurt Britney's career. I loved her and was a naive kid who had been raised to trust and respect my elders, just like she had."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Weren't Happy With This Edited Photo Sam Asghari Posted Of Britney Spears</a></span></p><p>He would further reveal that he was given an ultimatum, if things were good between the two after six months, they could've really tied the knot.</p><p>"We were told that if we still felt the same way about each other in six months, then we could have a big, white wedding. They strung me along for 30 days, which was how long it took to get the annulment finalized, so I couldn't contest it, and then they changed Britney's number so I couldn't talk to her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As we all know by now, it didn't exactly work out that way. Instead, Alexander claims he was completely blocked off by the family, so much so that Britney got her number changed just so he wouldn't be able to contact her.</p><p>It was a wild romance and one fans haven't thought about in quite some time, that was until Alexander decided to storm Britney's house for her wedding.</p><h2 id=jason-alexander-is-back-in-the-headlines-for-crashing-britney-spears-wedding>Jason Alexander Is Back In The Headlines For Crashing Britney Spears' Wedding</h2><p>Reported by TMZ, <a href=#>Jason Alexander attempted to crash Britney's wedding alongside Sam Asghari.</a> Not only did Alexander get on the property but it is also said that he passed security. Eventually, he was detained by force.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Somehow, Alexander was able to make it inside Britney's home, where he continued to live stream. He was eventually restrained outside."</p><p>"We're told the Ventura County Sheriff's Department responded for a trespassing call, and are still on the scene."</p><p>Alexander streamed part of the moment to IG Live before his live feed froze up. Jason was said to have been a supporter of Britney in the recent years, especially during the #FreeBritney movement which he took part in.</p><p>Booked for trespassing, vandalism and two batteries of Britney's security, Britney's former man might be facing some serious legal troubles in the upcoming days and months.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Britney Spears Says Posting Topless Pics Is "Enlightening" Post-Conservatorship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmmqKewa%2Bx2GaqqZ2Rp8Burc2dZKOZo6S7bq3Lnq%2BappSav3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cody-garbrandt-wife-danny-pimsanguan-everything-to-know-about-the-mma-fighter-and-his-love-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Cody Garbrandt Wife Danny Pimsanguan?
