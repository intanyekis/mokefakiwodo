Over the course of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sex and the City</a>, she has numerous flings and a handful of serious relationships, with each lover bringing his own challenges that Carrie must overcome. Although only one of these relationships works out in the end, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boyfriends and flings</a> that Carrie has on the show all teach her something different about love and she brings all that information together in her columns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main romantic players in Carrie’s life are John James ‘Big’ Preston and Aidan Shaw, followed by Jack Berger and Aleksandr Petrovsky. In between these men, she also has a few shorter flings with the likes of Bill Kelley and Ray King. Check out Carrie’s relationship timeline below!</p><h2 id=carrie-s-relationship-with-kurt-harrington-was-purely-physical><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Carrie’s Relationship With&nbsp;Kurt Harrington&nbsp;Was Purely Physical</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john-from-satc-pilot.png><p>In the pilot episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrie</a>&nbsp;tests out the theory that women can have sex like men.
