Halloweentown was directed by Duwayne Dunham and was the fourth DCOM. The movie was followed by three sequels- Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, Halloweentown High and Return to Halloweentown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film has an 80 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on critic's reviews. Complex Magazine put Halloweentown as number nine on the list of 'The 40 Best Disney Channel Original Movies.' Buzzfeed called the first three movies one of the best things about Halloween.</p><p>The franchise <a href=#>stars Kimberly J. Brown</a> and Debbie Reynolds, along with others. Brown, who played the lead character, Marnie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was replaced in the fourth movie </a>by Sarah Paxton. As Halloween approaches and you will be streaming these movies on Disey+, it's fun to see how far these actors have come.</p><p>Here's what the cast of the franchise, Halloweentown, is doing now.</p><h2 id=kimberly-j-brown><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kimberly J. Brown</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kimberly J.

Currently, she has a recurring role on General Hospital as Chloe Jennings.

She played Aggie Cromwell, Marnie's magical grandmother, and the most powerful witch in Halloweentown, in the movie series. The Singin' In The Rain star was the first actress cast in the film. "Debbie had decided she wanted to open herself up to doing some television. When we saw the list, we took one look at her name and said, ‘Oh my god, would she really do it? And she did. We never went to anyone else," Sheri Singer, the film’s executive producer, said in an interview with E!.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Top Disney Channel Original Movies Of The Last 30 Years, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=sara-paxton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sara Paxton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sara Paxton relaced Brown in the last movie, Return To Halloweentown. Many fans were confused at the time and so was the actress. There were rumors that Brown was not available due to scheduling conflicts and because they couldn't agree on how the final film would end, but none of that was true. However, she has said in the past that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she was available and desperately wanted to be a part of the final film</a>.

The former actress posts videos on TikTok and even went back to Oregon for the Spirit of Halloweentown event to celebrate the movie.
