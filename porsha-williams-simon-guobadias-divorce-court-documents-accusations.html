Guobadia had been married to Falynn Pina for only two years when they separated. What made <strong><a href=#>Real Housewives of Atlanta</a></strong>fans question <strong>everything about Porsha and Guobadia's relationship</strong> was that Porsha had been a friend of Pina’s on the show before she coupled up with her husband shortly after they separated.</p><p>The globetrotting couple shared their lavish trips and experiences through social media. <a href=#>Porsha and Simon got married in November 2022 in two glamorous wedding ceremonies attended by some Bravocelebrities</a>; a traditional Nigerian ceremony in Four Seasons Atlanta and an American ceremony in a local Methodist church. However, their relationship took an unexpected turn only 15 months into their marriage when Porsha filed for divorce in February 2024 after she found out about Simon’s past. This article will go through Porsha and Simon’s divorce, from court documents to their outrageous social media accusations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsha-williams-filed-for-divorce-from-simon-guobadia-because-of-his-criminal-past>Porsha Williams Filed For Divorce From Simon Guobadia Because Of His Criminal Past</h2><p>On February 22,<strong> Porsha Williams filed for divorce from Simon Guobadia after 15 months of marriage.</strong> According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Porsha admitted that reports of Simon's criminal history and the possibility of his deportation played a significant role in her decision to file for divorce. On January 11, 2024, Simon filed a case against the Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services after he requested citizenship and naturalization in July 2022, but his application was denied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/copy-of-untitled-22.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guobadia's filing opened a can of worms that exposed his checkered past. The Nigerian native first entered the US through a Visitor's Visa in 1982 but overstayed. He applied for citizenship but was denied and deported. Guobadia managed to re-enter the country in 1986 and overstayed again. During that time, Simon was involved in criminal activities, including illegal vehicle use in 1989 and bank and credit card fraud in 1987, 1990, and 1991.</p><p>Simon also engaged in identity theft and used multiple aliases to apply for temporary resident status under the Social Agricultural Worker program. According to reports, Simon's new identity of Guobadia got him permanent residency in 1992, only 26 days after being deported for overstaying his 1986 6-month Visa. With Simon's fake identity coming to light, Porsha felt it would be safer for her to cut ties with her husband as he had become like a 'stranger' to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Porsha-Williams-Simon-Guobadia-Jessica-Harris.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Porsha Williams Fiancé's Alleged Sidechick And Wife Speak Out">Porsha Williams Fiancé's Alleged Sidechick And Wife Speak Out</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A woman has come forward to claim she was dating Porsha Williams' fiancé, Simon Guobadia, last month.</p><p>Porsha said in court documents the reports of his alleged fraud and imminent threat of deportation affected her both emotionally and mentally because Simon never disclosed the information during their marriage despite her asking about his immigration history. Court documents also revealed the breakup text Porsha sent to Simon.</p><p>"There is nothing in this world that would have told me I would have to divorce you or that I would even contemplate leaving you even for a day. However, what is between us rocks our foundation to the core."</p><p>Porsha's lawyer said that since his client learned about Simon's history, she began questioning everything about his life and finances and uncovered additional information Guobadia had not disclosed. "Petitioner did not wish to remain married to a stranger and filed for divorce." Porsha is not the only one Simon has duped recently. A private jet company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>NetJets Aviation, accused Guobadia of failing to pay bills amounting to $887,000.</strong></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsha-williams-and-simon-guobadia-have-been-embroiled-in-a-legal-battle-since-divorce-filing>Porsha Williams And Simon Guobadia Have Been Embroiled In A Legal Battle Since Divorce Filing</h2><p>Since Porsha filed for divorce from Simon the two have been engaged in heated back and forth that played out in court documents. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star demanded a judge enforce the prenup they had both signed so that Simon would leave the mansion. According to Porsha, the legally binding document states that in the event of divorce, the husband would have to vacate the home within 30 days of filing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/copy-of-untitled-21.jpg><p>Guobadia allegedly requested an extension that would allow him to stay in his home until March 31, but Porsha refused it. On March 26, Porsha demanded an emergency hearing after Guobadia allegedly changed the locks and garage code of the mansion, thereby preventing her entry. In another court filing, Simon alleged that Porsha had voluntarily left their home and his children and returned with a gunman to pick up her belongings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Simon allegedly had to call the police on Porsha </strong>on March 21 to maintain the peace in his home. Three days later, Guobadia alleges, Williams returned to his home with his mother and her mother’s boyfriend where they disengaged security cameras and tampered with evidence. After Simon’s claims, Porsha made shocking allegations that her ex was trying to ruin her reputation and that Simon was playing with the truth by trying to say the encounter with her security was ‘hostile’.</p><p>In response, <strong>Porsha filed court documents accusing her ex of bringing three women to their home and cheating on her.</strong> Porsha’s lawyer, Randall M. Kessler stated,</p><p>“Wife has returned to the residence on various occasions to retrieve various personal items belonging to Wife and her minor child, as well as to secure various items, after learning that Husband had at least three women in the marital residence on different evenings.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simon went on to plead for a Georgia judge to grant him a restraining order against Porsha accusing her of vilifying, threatening, molesting and harassing him, his children and his staff in the home. The Nigerian native also asked the courts to bar Porsha from filming The Real Housewives of Atlanta in their marital home since she has a nearly $1.8 million home she still owns. He also demanded Porsha and Bravo to turn over any documents, photographs and unreleased footage they have filmed for the upcoming season in his home since February 2024 and a copy of his ex’s contract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a May filing from <a href=#>Porsha, who is currently worth less than $500k</a> now,<strong> she asked the court to make Simon pay her $50k for attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.</strong> But Simon’s lawyer argued that his ex’s demands were against Georgia law. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Real Housewives of Atlanta began filming season 16 in May 2024 with a few new cast members</a>, but with the former couple’s court battles, Porsha is not allowed to film inside her and Simon’s home. Porsha filed an emergency order on May 20 to allow her to film her day-to-day life in the home, since it is vital to her ability to sustain her income and employment.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/porsha-williams.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Real Reason Why ‘RHOA’ Star Porsha Williams Was Once ‘Fired’ From The Show">The Real Reason Why ‘RHOA’ Star Porsha Williams Was Once ‘Fired’ From The Show</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The cast was stunned by Williams’ move to get physical with her co-star.</p><p>The Bravo star argued since<strong> Simon dragged The Real Housewives of Atlanta production company</strong>, Truly Original, into their legal battle, they will not proceed with filming her for the upcoming season, significantly affecting her income. She claimed in court documents she would not film in areas that are personal to Simon or areas that contain his personal information, like his bathroom, closet and office, but Simon refused and urged the courts to stay silent on the matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simon didn’t stop there. In court documents dated May 21, Simon demanded Dino Bones Production Inc., behind Dish Nation to provide all contracts, agreements and income statements and amendments involving his ex’s work from 2021 to present. He wants all documents regarding her income and compensation. Guobadia is also demanding monthly account transactions, loans and safety deposit boxes from the Bank of America and City National Bank from January 2022 to the present date.</p><p>Porsha has already filed motions to throw out the subpoena from The Real Housewives of Atlanta producers and will likely do the same for Dish Nation and the banks. Porsha is still unable to film in the mansion she once shared with her ex, but according to insiders close to production, this issue will not stop Porsha from appearing in the upcoming season, even if she is not in the home. While Porsha has been filming, Simon has been spending time with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeezy, who is also in the midst of a nasty divorce battle with ex, Jennie Mai.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsha-williams-and-simon-guobadia-took-their-divorce-to-social-media>Porsha Williams And Simon Guobadia Took Their Divorce To Social Media</h2><p>After filing for divorce, Simon began making jabs at Porsha on social media. He deleted their lavish photos from his account and started making cryptic posts about his ex. On May 24, <strong>Simon captioned one of his posts calling Porsha a 'pig" </strong>"A pig with lipstick does not make one beautiful because when the lipstick fades, all you see is what remains…a pig."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/copy-of-untitled-24.jpg><p>The caption prompted Porsha to respond in her Instagram post, accusing her ex of having a criminal past and faking his identity to obtain a Green card. Simon replied on his page a few days later, "I need people who think there are 265 days in a year to stay out of complex US immigration laws. Above your mediocre mind."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simon didn't stop there. He went to The Bravo Shade Room's comments and said, "Despite not holding US Citizenship, this immigrant with 34+ years of impeccable credit history secured a $7,000,000 home," he wrote. "The property is now inhabited by a US citizen who was once married to me for precisely 453 days. Just imagine that."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pillar-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Porsha Williams Is Raising Her Daughter, Pilar Jhena McKinley">How Porsha Williams Is Raising Her Daughter, Pilar Jhena McKinley</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Williams has juggled raising her daughter and her growing business ventures.</p><p>Simon's most recent shade came on Real Housewives of Atlanta newbie Shamea Morton's Instagram post, where she posed next to her new Rolls-Royce. "Congratulations, my good sis. I'm so happy for you. My brother Gerald has excellent taste in fine cars. I look forward to watching the only cast member with a Rolls-Royce." Porsha didn't take the attack lying down, responding to her ex's comment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Simon, don't forget a debt-free husband who is a US citizen! My bestie is winning. Welcome to RHOA Queen Mumbi!." Just before Simon and Porsha's wedding in 2022, he had gifted her a $400,000 Rolls-Royce, which many fans suspect he had taken back. Porsha and Simon's divorce still plays out in public and in court until they finalize their separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-poster.jpeg><h5 class=display-card-title>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</h5>TV-14Reality <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 7, 2008</span> <strong>Creator(s)</strong> <span>Scott Dunlop</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>NeNe Leakes , DeShawn Snow , Sheree Whitfield , Lisa Wu , Kim Zolciak , Kandi Burruss , Cynthia Bailey , Phaedra Parks , Kenya Moore , Porsha Williams , Claudia Jordan , Kim Fields , Shamari DeVoe , Eva Marcille</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>15</span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Scott Dunlop</span> <strong>Streaming Service(s)</strong> <span>Bravo , E! , Peacock</span> <strong>Franchise(s)</strong> <span>The Real Housewives</span> Expand<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinqKqjna5uw8ilo6KZnah6tLXMqKVmn6Wkr6KwyJqqZpyZq7yzr8Rmmqitoql6pbvCrqSepqSoeqKvwq6qmqyZpLu0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jess-search-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jess search wikipedia, doc society, twitter, announcement">&larr;
