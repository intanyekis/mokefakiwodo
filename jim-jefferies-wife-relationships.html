We’re hoping to meet Jim Jefferies’ wife shortly.</p><p>In the past, Jim Jefferies and Kate Luyben were a couple.</p><p>Jefferies and Kate Luyben met while filming the pilot for Jefferies’ 2013 TV series Legit in 2011. Kate portrayed a prostitute in the pilot. In a short period, the pair became excellent friends and began dating. The couple became pregnant with their first kid just months after they began dating.</p><p>Jefferies and Luyben welcomed their baby, Hank, on November 7, 2012. At the premiere of Legit, Jefferies disclosed that Luyben was his girlfriend and they had recently had a kid together a few months after the birth of their child.</p><p>Jefferies and Kate Luyben split up shortly after.

However, during his September 2019 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the comic publicly discussed his new relationship. He also revealed in the episode that he was in a relationship with a British female.</p><p>Jeffries also stated that his current partner and his son, Hank, whom he had with his former Kate Luyben, are extremely close. Meanwhile, he claims Luyben lives nearby and is presently dating a soccer player. Jeffries stated that the two couples have spent a lot of time together and have even gone on vacation together.</p><p>Despite the revelations, Jeffries’ new girlfriend’s identity remains unknown because he did not divulge her name on the broadcast.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Notyourgothgirlfriend, Medukarabu, and Lili Sixx."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":32}{"1":34,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":59}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/notyourgothgirlfriend/"}{"1":32}{"1":34,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/medukarabu/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/lili-sixx/"}{"1":59}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Medukarabu</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lili Sixx</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a> <a href=# rel=tag>television host</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Who Is Claire Pearsall | Meet Nigel Nelson Wife | Married Life And Kids</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Rochelle Anthony Husband | Who Is She Married To | Family & Net Worth</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn7auecmenZ%2Bdop6ytHnWop2eZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpcBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-aloni.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Aloni">&larr;
