The song’s inspiration comes from the culture and atmosphere of South Central Los Angeles, where ScHoolboy Q grew up.</p><p>In an interview with Complex, ScHoolboy Q explains that “Collard Greens” was inspired by the feeling of being in a party in LA. He wanted to create a track that captured the energy and vibe of the city. ScHoolboy Q wanted to create a soundtrack for the summer, a song that people could play at their parties and get-togethers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics_of_%E2%80%9CCollard_Greens%E2%80%9D></span>The Lyrics of “Collard Greens”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the concept behind “Collard Greens” is simple and carefree, the lyrics are not. The first verse tackles ScHoolboy Q’s experience growing up in South Central LA. He raps, “Born in the city of the sirens / Los Angeles where the s*t gets violent / Not a stranger to this, life of sin / But you can be anything, if you put your mind to this.”</p><p>The second verse talks about his success as a rapper and how he’s become a role model for kids in his neighborhood. ScHoolboy Q raps, “From the block to the booth, I dip divide / Everywhere I go, I’ma have my city on my side.”</p><p>Throughout the song, ScHoolboy Q references several staples of LA culture, such as palm trees, In-N-Out Burger, and Compton. The chorus, sung by Kendrick Lamar, is the most recognizable and catchy part of the song. He repeats the phrase “Oh, oh, luxury / Chiddy-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that / Oh, oh, collard greens / Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_Behind_%E2%80%9CCollard_Greens%E2%80%9D></span>The Meaning Behind “Collard Greens”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While “Collard Greens” may seem like a fun and carefree song on the surface, it’s much deeper than that.
