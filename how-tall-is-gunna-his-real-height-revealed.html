At his height, he falls in the category of American males that are average in height. There are speculations that the rapper’s height is below the above-listed height, however, these speculations have been confirmed to be false, as the rapper has been physically compared with other rappers who stand at 5 feet 10 inches and is found to be of the same height with them.</p><p>Going by the 2018 report by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has it that the average height for American males is 5 feet 9 inches, Gunna is considered above average by just one inch.</p><h3><strong>Gunna’s Height Compared To His Girlfriend Chloe Bailey</strong></h3><p>Chloe Bailey is an American actress, singer, and songwriter. She is known for her song Have Mercy and for being part of the music duo, Chloe X Halle. The singer also gained recognition for being in a relationship with Gunna.</p><p>According to reports, the Have Mercy singer reportedly stands at the height of 5 feet, 5 inches. When compared with Gunna height, she is about 5 inches shorter than the rapper. They have an obvious height difference whenever they are spotted together. However, Chloe Bailey usually wears high heels to balance out the difference.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Gunna-and-chloe-bailey.jpg alt="Gunna Height" width=696 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>This doesn’t mean that <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Chloe Bailey</a> is short in height since the average height for American women is pegged at 5 feet 4 inches. At least she is an inch taller than an average American woman.</p><h2><strong>How Tall Is Gunna Compared To His Fellow Rappers</strong></h2><p>It is now a known fact that Gunna’s height is above the average height for adult male Americans. Meanwhile, when it comes to other rappers in the industry, he may be short compared to some, average compared to others, and tall compared to some others. Here is a comparison between Gunna’s height and that of some American rappers.</p><h3><strong>Gunna Vs. Young Thug?</strong></h3><p>Gunna is a few inches shorter than Yung Thug. Yung Thug is one of the American rappers whose height makes Gunna appear very short. Yung Thug’s height is 6 feet 3 inches, which is over 4 inches taller when compared with height of Gunna.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Young-Thug-and-Gunna.jpg alt width=696 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>However, when comparing them in most of their music videos, they seem to be the same height. Gunna most times make use of foot wears with a high sole to increase his height. This is so evident in the video by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Gunna & Future- Pushin P ft Young Thug</a>.</p><h3><strong>Gunna’s Height is the Same as Travis Scott’s</strong></h3><p>Travis Scott, whose discography has been overshadowed as the boyfriend of Kylie Jenner, has a height of 5 feet 10 inches. Scott’s height confirms the fact that Gunna truly stands at 5 feet 10 inches, as he claims since they are both of the same height.</p><p>Their equal height can also be seen in the music video titled <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Hot, </a>which features Young Thug, Gunna, and Travis Scott.</p><h3><strong>Gunna’s Height Compared To Lil Baby</strong></h3><p>From his name, one can easily guess that Lil Baby is below average height even before getting to know his height. This is because the tag ‘Lil’ in the stage name of most American entertainers means that they acknowledge that they are short in stature.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Gunna-and-Lil-Baby-1.jpg alt="Gunna Height" width=696 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>However, in the case of Lil Baby, who is 5 feet 8 inches, he is just an inch below the CDC-reported average height. Then, compared to the height of Gunna, Lil Baby is 2 inches shorter.</p><h2><strong>Gunna Weight and</strong></h2><h3><strong>Other Body Measurements</strong></h3><p>The 30-year-old American rapper weighs 68 kg (150 lbs.). His weight, according to the result provided by the BMI calculator (21.5 kg/m²), is healthy, considering his height, age, and gender.</p><p>Gunna’s other body measurements are listed as follows; 38-30-13 inches for his chest, waist, and biceps, respectively. The rapper’s chest size seems to be a little bit wider than it should be. The average chest size for someone within his age range of 25 to 30 years with a height of 5 feet 10 inches is 33.5 inches.</p><p>However, his waist and bicep sizes are very perfect for his physique, as he is not interested in gaining much of a muscular figure.</p><p>Gunna is not much of the type that shows his abs even while on stage, but he often displays pictures of them and also his tattoos on his Instagram. From the pictures, it can be seen that the rapper doesn’t have very pronounced abs. He is seen to have a bit of body fat, which shields his abs from being too visible.</p><p>He stated that his workout routine is mainly one or two hours of running in the morning. We hope to see Gunna work out his body fat to the recommended 10% in order for his abs to show properly. Maybe adding more hours to his morning run and a routine gym visit can help him achieve a perfect body structure.</p><h3><strong>Does Gunna Have A Diet Plan?</strong></h3><p>Ever since the rapper was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2019, he embraced a diet plan that once made him a vegan. He was advised to adopt a vegetarian diet plan that is void of meat, fish, and honey. Recently, he stated that he is no longer a vegan, stressing that he wants to eat meat whenever he wants.</p><p>His daily diet plan includes a well-balanced diet that consists of protein and healthy carbohydrates. He also takes enough water daily to stay hydrated in order to maintain optimum health. Gunna admits that his workout routine and new diet plan have helped him lose a few pounds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC0zrBkrZmcoXqqv4ygrKemkWK1qr%2BMq5yapF2dsqqzx61kq52mmq6tscNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peter-brown.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Brown">&larr;
