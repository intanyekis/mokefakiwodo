In this resurfaced clip from September 11, 1984, which became popular on TikTok, a remarkable and unusual scenario unfolded. None of the three contestants managed to answer the Final Jeopardy question correctly in fact, all three contestants had wagered their entire earnings on the final question, resulting in them losing everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jpg_20230823_223425_0000.jpg><p>During the Final Jeopardy round, Trebek would reveal the category for the question, and contestants were given the duration of the commercial break to place their final wagers, with partitions separating them. Following this, they had 30 seconds to formulate their response in the form of a question after Trebek presented the clue.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Alex Trebek Bought His Wife, Jean Currivan, One Of The Most Outrageous Gifts Known To Man</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If their answer was accurate, their earnings would increase by the amount they wagered, but an incorrect answer would lead to a deduction of the wagered amount from their total.</p><p>Consequently, they were left with no winnings and no returning champion for the subsequent episode. Amid the surprising outcome, Trebek expressed his astonishment, admitting, "I'm at a loss for words. But, in a situation like this..." He humorously noted, "Easy come, easy go, but each of our contestants wound up with nothing, but we have consolation prizes for them."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-alex-trebek>What Happened To Alex Trebek?</h2><p>According to CBS News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Trebek passed away on November 8, 2020, at 80</a>.
