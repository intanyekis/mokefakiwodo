In case you haven’t you should know that she is a Vlogger, podcast host, businesswoman, and an exotic model. She is also the wife of singer, songwriter, and rapper, Jelly Roll.</strong></p><p>The <strong>43</strong>-year-old wife of Jelly Roll has been with him since they got married in 2016 and has helped raise his kid. Despite being called a golddigger for her relationship with the singer, she has proven the naysayers wrong as she has been more of a great support to her husband and his career.</p><p><b><p>Personal Profile</p></b></p><h2><strong>Bunnie DeFord was born in Nevada</strong></h2><p></p><p>Jelly Roll’s wife was born on January 22, 1980, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her father is known as Bill and she grew up as trouble maker although according to her, she didn’t know how she always attracted trouble.</p><p>Her mother was said to have been an addict who ran away with her then-<a href=# rel=noopener>musician’s father</a> band mate and left her to fate as a baby. She was later raised by Bill and her stepmother but in a strict and up-tight environment.</p><p>At the age of 14, Bunnie dropped out of high school and ran away from home. Never returning, she began a journey that, could be said, to be the beginning of her career and the subsequent fame it brought.</p><h2><strong>How Bunnie DeFord and Jelly Roll Met</strong></h2><p>Jelly Roll born Jason DeFord and his wife Bunnie DeFord tell different stories about how they met. While the former gave a funny story about the first time they met, stating that it was at a plus-size male strip club in 2013, his wife tells otherwise.</p><p>Bunnie gave a more detailed insight into how they met. She said they met during a Sin City Country Saloon performance. She didn’t know who Jelly Roll was before she saw him at that concert he was opening for.</p><p>According to the exotic model, she fell in love with the ‘saddest eyes in the room’. Jason did not use to smile or laugh at the time of their meeting and he seemed like a sad man.</p><p>Prior to, and at the time of the meeting in 2012, Bunnie Xo was in an abusive relationship.</p><p>Fast forward to a while later, after breaking up with her then-boyfriend, the <strong>43</strong>-year-old model shot her shot at the<strong>&nbsp;39</strong>-year-old singer. She asked a mutual friend to link them up and that was the beginning of their beautiful marriage that has lasted for 6 years now.</p><p>Jason even confessed that it was more than love at first sight for him when they met. He stated that when they hugged, he felt her soul and fell in love with it too.</p><p>The couple got married on August 31, 2016, after he made a public proposal to her at Yelawolf/Deftone’s show. Jason and his wife immediately went on to get married despite it being almost midnight.</p><p>The start of their relationship wasn’t all rosy and the couple even admitted that <a href=# rel=noopener>they split up for a month in 2018</a> because the relationship was toxic. However, the DeFords seem to be enjoying a stress-free marriage now.</p><h2><strong>Her Journey in Entertainment Covers a Host of Aspects</strong></h2><p>Bunnie DeFord began her entertainment journey as a model and <a href=# rel=noopener>starred on Playboy TV</a>. She also served as a vixen for music videos including those of her husband, Jelly Roll.</p><p>Now, she owns and hosts a couple of vlogs on YouTube which comprises her Bunnie Whorelympics show and Meet the DeFords Vlog. In the same vein, Bunnie is the host of her own podcast known as the ‘Dumb Blonde Podcast.</p><p>Additionally, she is a businesswoman whose website shows that she owns a <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Dumb blonde’ online shop</a> with plans of selling several types of merchandise.</p><p>Bunnie Xo also has an Onlyfans account which she has confessed earns her quite a fortune. She still works as an exotic model and vixen according to pictures and videos of her posted on her Instagram account.</p><p>On Facebook, the Dumb Blonde host announced that she would be hosting about 2000 people to a live podcast show at the Nashville Comedy Fest by April of 2023. This was a huge deal for her as her post was full of excitement.</p><h2><strong>Jelly Roll’s Wife is the Stepmother to his Daughter</strong></h2><p>Bunnie and Jason DeFord do not have any children yet but the model and social media sensation is the mother to Jelly Roll’s daughter from his previous relationship.</p><p>Jason has a daughter named Bailee Ann who was born on May 22, 2008, by Felicia, an ex-girlfriend.</p><p>The mother of Bailee had been battling drug addiction for a while but got sober in 2019. She was also incarcerated for a while.</p><p>For 4 years, Bunnie and her husband had total custody of Bailee Ann until Felicia’s sobriety resurfaced in their lives. However, they have had joint custody of her for longer. Now, the girl follows in her father’s footsteps as she is a musician. She is also a makeup artist and a fashionista.</p><p>Other sources state that DeFord has another child, a son named Noah. Although there are no pictures of him and the boy on his social media, it is reported that Bunnie also accepts him too.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Francesca Francone Architect Is Sananda Maitreyas Wife: All Untold Facts</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Why Bunnie XO was Referred to as a Golddigger</strong></h2><p>As stated in the introduction, Bunnie Xo has been called a golddigger in the past because of her relationship with the ‘Son of Sinner’ singer. The title which gets her riled up amuses her husband because that’s far from the truth.</p><p>According to the musician, when he met his wife, he was homeless while his wife was already made with a home and luxuries. He said all thanks to Bunnie, he was alleviated from his state and if there was anyone gold digging at the time, it was him.</p><p>Since Jelly Roll’s wife came into his life, she helped shape a lot of things. Bunnie helped manage his career and home and has even turned him from the ‘saddest eyes in the room’ to a very happy and fulfilled man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikn6uysLTLrqqtZpOkunC2xKWjsmWipLmtedainZ5lkqq7r7XEZpuenp%2BnsW6x1Z6psqyYnruoew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./william-atherton-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="William Atherton Net Worth">&larr;
