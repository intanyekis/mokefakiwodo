She became a mom two months after her public appearance sparked pregnancy rumors. The "Casper" actress was spotted at LAX Airport, Los Angeles, with a visible baby bump.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after the news spread, her spokesperson confirmed she was expecting. In August of that same year, Freddie joined Ricci and her husband, Heerdegen as their first child. The new parents were delighted to have a plus one, and a close source revealed they were ready for the journey ahead.</p><p class=dh>Fans would recall that Freddie's mom gushed on her then-husband following their wedding, admitting that she would love to build a family with him. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/christina-ricci-welcomes-baby-boy-201488/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He's my favorite person on Earth.

It happened when Goreski mistakenly referred to her child as a dog!</p><p class=dh>The interviewer inquired about her baby, and Ricci admitted that she had two, and they were bonding just fine.

Ultimately, the arrangement helps Freddie maintain a close relationship with both parents.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FREDDIE FOUND OUT HIS MOM WAS AN ACTRESS WHEN HE WAS 3</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite her fame and fortune, Ricci, a former child star actress, did not buy into sharing her celebrity status with her son at an early age.</p><p class=dh>She intended for him to have a typical childhood, but that did not last long. Soon, Freddie knew that his mother was a Hollywood icon. Ricci revealed that he was only 3½-year-old and a preschooler when he asked if she was famous. The long-time actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-son-freddie-casper-movie-1995/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He's come home from preschool and been out in the world and said to me, 'Mama, are you a movie actress?' And I didn't say that to him. People mention it to him."</p><p class=dh>Since her son was curious, she decided to show him, and Ricci confessed that he had watched some of her early features.</p><p class=dh>At first, Freddie was not interested in seeing his mom's younger version, but later, he became excited about the movies. So she showed him "Casper," the movie where Ricci's character befriends a ghost.</p><p class=dh>However, the actress noticed that it made Freddie overly curious and unable to distinguish reality from the onscreen pictures. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-son-freddie-casper-movie-1995/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He started asking me about my childhood with my best friend, the ghost. And we were like, 'Oh! Too soon.' For a while, he was asking me a lot about ghosts and living alone with my dad and being a ghost, and we were just like, 'Oh no!.'"</p><p class=dh>Despite Freddie's reaction as a little boy, his mother is open to him pursuing a career in acting if he ever becomes interested in it.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FREDDIE IS AN OLDER BROTHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Although Freddie's likes or dislikes are yet to make the news, he has one adorable title, big brother! The 8-year-old has a half-sister named Cleopatra Ricci Hampton, aka baby Cleo. The youngest member of the clan was born in December 2021.</p><p class=dh>Her parents are Ricci and Mark Hampton, the actress's second husband. Despite being a few years older, the "Casper" actress proudly announced her romance with Hampton last July.</p><p class=dh>A few weeks later, she said they would expect their first child. Despite having two kids, the actress has been hands-on in parenting.</p><p class=dh>In 2017, <a class="me a" href=#>Ricci</a> pledged allegiance to motherhood when she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/christina-ricci-gives-birth-to-2nd-child-1st-with-mark-hampton/>revealed</a> that "having a child forces you to grow up at the speed of light." So far, she seems to be putting her kids first in whatever decision she makes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbWlnZXqnvsSdm6KdXZ2ypr7Dnp6epl2srrR5zairZqqVlrG6edaaq5ygXZiub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shawn-mendes-vine-fame-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Shawn Mendes Climbed The Vine To Fame &amp;amp; Fortune">&larr;
