Heinicke and Casey attended the same college.</p><p>The 29-year-old American football quarterback is no longer in a relationship with Casey, as they both parted ways in 2018. They kept most of their relationship details under the rug, and so did their break up, as they did not let it come out to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t until Casey shared a photo online showing her sharing a kiss with another man on a beach in Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Fans of Heinicke found what they witnessed to be wholly unexpected and hard to believe.</p><p>Heinicke has moved on from that relationship, and now he mainly focuses on his football career. He plays quarterback for an NFL club, Washington Commanders, and is on the team lineup to face Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, November 27.</p><h2 id=taylor-heinicke-and-ex-girlfriend-casey-fehrle><span class=ez-toc-section id=taylor-heinicke-and-ex-girlfriend-casey-fehrle-dating-life></span> Taylor Heinicke And Ex Girlfriend Casey Fehrle Dating Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor Heinicke and his ex-girlfriend Casey Fehrle ended their relationship in 2018 after dating for several years.</p><p>Heinicke and Casey met at Old Dominion University since they both attended the same university. The NFL star received an athletic scholarship and enrolled in the college in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>They began their relationship as friends and slowly took a step further before they finally started dating in 2013. Heinicke played for the university football team, the Old Dominion Monarchs football, and Casey would cheer him from the stand.</p><p>Casey quickly became a famous university football wag as their relationship prospered. In June 2015, Taylor and his girlfriend, Casey, visited the Children’s Hospital of The Kings Daughters, where they met many children and had fun with them.&nbsp;</p><p>The official Facebook page of the hospital posted a picture of the couple with one of the girl patients named Brielle McPherson, who showed them how to make a beaded bracelet.</p><p>Besides, Taylor is not a social guy, and he does not prefer going out. Casey pointed out about his this habit when they were together. She said, “The thing he appreciates most is a home-cooked meal and a quiet night.”</p><p>His former girlfriend Casey also added Taylor is a shy person who prefers to stay out of media and the limelight.</p><h2 id=casey-fehrle-is-married><span class=ez-toc-section id=casey-fehrle-is-married></span> Casey Fehrle Is Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Casey Fehrle is now married to another man named Alex Kliesh.&nbsp;</p><p>Heinicke is reportedly single after his secret break with up with former lover Casey who is now wedded to Alex Kliesh. She has a boy child with her husband, Alex. Her son’s name is Hudson Alexander Kliesh, born on May 20, 2020.</p><p>Taylor and Heinicke parted ways in 2018, kept their breakup a secret, and did not let most people know about it. They seemed like an excellent fit, and his fans were optimistic about Heinicke’s love relationship with Casey.</p><p>But ultimately, things did not go well, and they split somewhere in 2018. Soon after the breakup, the 29-year-old Washington Commanders quarterback gathered all his ruins and redirected his focus to football and his career.</p><p>Meanwhile, his ex-lover Casey, an ophthalmologist, began a new relationship with Alex Kliesh, the owner of Morrisville material transport LLC. On Instagram, She has posted every moment of her love life with Alex, from the beginning of their relationship to getting pregnant, having a child, and growing as a family.</p><p>On September 26, she recently uploaded a picture of her husband, Alex, on one knee with a ring proposing to her. Their two-year-old son sits on a stone, smiling and enjoying the memories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyRrrmwvoyhnKKmmZi4pnnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjJyYrJ2pYrOmtNGlnGaglaG9prCMoaCmZaSdv7DBxqFkraelnLVuwMimnKxlmaN6pLvLpZygnV1ofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-cast-of-victorious-ranked-by-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Cast Of 'Victorious' Ranked By Net Worth">&larr;
