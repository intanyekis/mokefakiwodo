The Brooklyn-born Sanders lived much of his early life in Flatbush, New York; spending up until his early adulthood, from the 1940s till the early 1960s. He played basketball and ran track as a youth, yet the luxury of life was scarce for Sanders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up in a Jewish household, struggles had become his motivation to bring financial and social equality to all backgrounds. With that intent, he embarked on a life that was abstract, yet consistent toward his goal.</p><p><strong>A Class of other Creative Writers and Activists</strong></p><p>Sanders started at Brooklyn College, a CUNY college in New York. He is one of many notable alums, such as Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos, CNN's Don Lemon, and actor James Franco. He then finished school at the University of Chicago, a school with Pulitzer Prize-winning alums in Roger Ebert, as well as fellow activist and novelist in Susan Sontag. In Chicago, it was where the-then political science major participated in the Civil Rights Movement in 1963. Looking at the people who came before and after him, it foretold the impact young Bernie was willing to make.</p><p><strong>The Civil Rights Activist</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Visualizing the harsh school situations for the segregated African Americans, Sanders joined a group of protesters to fight for them. Like many others who disobeyed police orders, Sanders was arrested, to be bailed out by the next morning. Who bailed him out? None other than the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, better known as the NAACP. Working for CORE (Congress of Racial Equality)&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Chicago's&nbsp;Student Peace Committee.</p><p>Sanders played a role in many practices. Practices including sit-ins, speeches, and case studies, which exposed the discrimination between the colored and the whites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is an interesting thing to think about. Sanders had been inspired by politics through stories of his relatives. The sad stories of the Holocaust, the rise of Hitler, and the news that covered it all. Perhaps his family's oppression provides some an added element of motivation to bring change to the oppressed in the inner-cities.</p><p><strong>The Teacher</strong></p><p>After his college graduation, Sanders tried his hand at teaching. He taught Political Science at Hamilton College and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government respectively. Using a voice that he used in school, but would have a higher purpose for in due time. But that did have to wait.</p><p><strong>The Agriculturalist</strong></p><p>Sanders spent time in Israel, where he would live on a kibbutz, traditionally an agricultural community.</p><p>Back home, Sanders did not stray away from that path on his way either.&nbsp;He moved to Vermont, initially working as a union carpenter and freelance journalist.</p><p>Seriously, just imagine&nbsp;him back then out on a farm, relaxing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bernie-sanders-uofc-1441222704.jpg><p><strong>War Activist</strong></p><p>It was during that time when the Vietnam War was taking place, a war he and many others were against. According to <a href=#>History Collection</a>, it was stated while he did not criticize soldiers, he applied for the 'conscientious objector' status.</p><p>It was stated that the status "allowed people to apply so they wouldn’t get drafted based on opposing the war due to their right to do so as an American Citizen." Though the application was not accepted,&nbsp;Sanders' age, in his late 20s at the time,&nbsp;rendered him ineligible for the draft.</p><p><strong>Debs Ties</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the journey back into politics, Sanders left&nbsp;the Liberty Union Party.&nbsp;Upon his exit,&nbsp;he&nbsp;worked for the American Peoples Historical Society.&nbsp;During his time there, Sanders worked on a 30-minute documentary on famous Socialist and ex-Presidential Candidate, Eugene V. Debs.</p><p>Another historical figure that shaped his trajectory.</p><p><strong>TV Star</strong></p><p>Amidst the&nbsp;political rise, the Vermont resident cut his teeth in media, as during 1986 and 1988,&nbsp;he was the host and producer&nbsp;for his show Bernie Speaks with the Community. But he was not done there.</p><p><strong>Bernie N'the Gang?</strong></p><p>Bernie Sanders made a folk album. Yes, this happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sanders dropped a record that focused on the landscape&nbsp;of the United States. While informative, it would make radio personalities salivating for music-based interviews. Either that or a show open for Jimmy Fallon:</p><p><strong>Movie Mogul&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After his singing career, Sanders took to acting,&nbsp;having&nbsp;a cameo role in&nbsp;1988's&nbsp;Sweet Hearts Dance&nbsp;with Susan&nbsp;Sarandon and in 1999's My X-Girlfriend’s Wedding Reception&nbsp;as a rabbi during a wedding scene with singer Debbie Gibson.</p><p>It is not that hard to think of politicians being in movies these days. As the current POTUS has had his fair share of appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, you'd be surprised to know that Sanders has some hidden gems up his sleeve as well.</p><p>It is crazy to think that&nbsp;Sanders <a href=#>believed</a> that he would not last as long as a politician. Even now it is hard to imagine a world where a man with his beliefs would be believed in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Much Bernie Sanders Is Worth</a></span></p><p>It is safe to say that without Bernie in the public eye, we would miss out on too many gems like this:</p><p>Or this:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of the opinion&nbsp;on him, his many moments are admirable. And though it seems as if he's done it all, he's not quite done yet.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What John McCain's Family Fortune Is Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJudoqO2pnnSmqWdnaKoeqW1w2aZnp6fp7JuvM6loK2hk6h8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-was-hallmarks-the-gift-of-peace-filmed-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Was Hallmarks The Gift of Peace Filmed?">&larr;
