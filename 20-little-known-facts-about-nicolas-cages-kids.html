There is even a huge section dedicated to him on Reddit, with fans worshiping and referring to him as the One True God.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amidst all of Nick’s own troubles with the law, tax evasion problems, and especially marital problems, it can be easy to forget about his children. Despite never marrying, Nicolas and actress Christina Fulton had Weston Coppola Cage in 1990. Over the years, Nicolas Cage has been linked to many famous actresses, such as Angelina Jolie and even Sarah Jessica Parker, but it wasn’t until he met Patricia Arquette that he finally got married for the first time. A year after the divorce, he married Lisa Marie Presley, only to once again divorce and this time, marry former waitress Alice Kim just two months after meeting her. It’s with his third wife that he had his second son Kal-El Coppola Cage, born in 2005. Despite his third marriage lasting longer than all of his previous ones, they separated after six years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kal-El is still young and clearly highly sheltered by his mom, but there is a good chance that he might end up making headlines the same way that his older brother Weston has over the years.</p><h2 id=beefin-up-with-a-little-help>Beefin’ Up With A Little Help</h2><p>In just the span of a decade, Nicolas Cage's eldest son Weston has become virtually unrecognizable. Once a metal-head wearing heavy eyeliner and sporting long hair, Nic's hot mess of a son has turned himself into a much more respectable version of himself, complete with a short haircut, stylish clothes and a muscular physique.</p><p>It's no secret that stars in both the acting and music world resort to a little help getting in shape at the gym. The bulging veins and the dramatic bodily change speak for themselves, but in Weston's case, the evidence isn't necessarily clear cut. Did he get fat or did he use his father to score a connection for some juice? Your guess is as good as ours, but the pictures definitely speak for themselves, even though on his Insta, he tried to claim: "My body is my instrument and my mind and soul are the perpetual fires." Looks like his body isn't his only instrument.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mental-breakdown-at-21-over-a-menu-item>Mental Breakdown At 21 Over A Menu Item</h2><p>It's not every day that a major Hollywood&nbsp;actor&nbsp;will find his son "beaten to a pulp" and yet that's exactly what happened to Nicolas Cage in 2011. A frantic Nick was caught on camera, climbing into the back of an ambulance, where his son Weston lay, having been hit in the face. As reported by both TMZ and the Daily Mail, Weston apparently went crazy after being denied a certain menu item at a restaurant. Things quickly got out of hand, with Weston attempting to kick his personal trainer, only to get beaten. He was subsequently put on a psychiatric hold.</p><p>In a post later published on his Facebook, Weston admitted to suffering from Bipolar Disorder: "I was misdiagnosed with bipolar and approved cogent when [trainer] Kevin [Villegas] assaulted me I was too drunk to fight back, thats why I'm not sore about the video."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dui-after-car-chase-amp-crash>DUI After Car Chase & Crash</h2><p>Nothing like a grown man sitting cross-legged while crying his eyes out on a stranger's lawn. All things considered, anyone would be doing the same following a high speed chase ending in a crash. While he was cruising around in the San Fernando Valley back in February 2017, Nic's son Weston got into a minor car accident. As TMZ reported, he was apparently willing to exchange information with the other driver but fled the moment the cops showed up, undoubtedly scared that they would bust him for a DUI. Despite engaging a high speed chase with the cops, Weston ultimately lost control of his car, drove onto a lawn, and took a couple of mailboxes and a street sign down. He even lost a tire in the process.</p><p>Obviously, trying to escape the cops is never a good idea and he made things far worse for himself than they could have been. It was later uncovered by TMZ that his alcohol&nbsp;level was almost twice the legal limit. He plead no contest and was faced with having to complete a 3-month alcohol program, along with choosing to either spend 45 days in jail&nbsp;or do 350 hours of community service. Since we haven't heard anything about him doing any jail time, there is a good chance that he went with community service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wacky-name-choice>Wacky Name Choice</h2><p>Back in 2004, when Nic first met his second wife Alice Kim, he was so head over heels for the former LA waitress that he proposed just two months after they met. They wasted no time and in October 2005, Kal-El Coppola Cage was born.</p><p>As he explained to People Magazine: "My wife wanted a unique name and originally I thought of the name Kyle and then she said, ‘No, something more unusual but beautiful.’ Then I remembered the old Superman comics and Kal-El was his original name on Krypton. So I wanted a name that stood for something good, was unique and American and that’s all three. I just thought it was a beautiful name and it had kind of a magical ring to it."</p><h2 id=brothers-are-no-longer-in-touch>Brothers Are No Longer In Touch</h2><p>Only a handful of pics of Weston and Kal-El hanging out together can be found on the web, with one being during a trip to Disneyland, another with them exiting a restaurant and one of them visiting Knott's Berry Farm. Their father Nicolas is present in all of these and in none of them are the brothers seen walking close to each other. Not only that, but there are literally no pictures of the brothers ever hanging out together alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kal-El is still too young to necessarily care about establishing an online social presence as he is just 12, but even Weston, who posts regularly to his Insta, has absolutely zero pictures of the two of them together. It's clear that after their father separated from Kal-El's mother, the brothers have had absolutely no contact. But whose fault is that? Do the brothers even care to keep in touch? Our guess is that Kal-El's mother is likely keeping her son away from Nic's troubled eldest.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-nic-responsible-for-his-son-s-troubles>How Much Is Nic Responsible For His Son's Troubles?</h2><p>After Weston was put on a psychiatric hold for going crazy outside of a restaurant over a menu item, his mother Christina Fulton confided to CNN that she believed that Nic was to blame for their son's troubles. She had even asked the doctor to keep Weston longer than necessary at the UCLA Medical Center, claiming: "I do not want him with Nicolas Cage. I do not want him in that care. That is not the care my son needs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My son is under a spell, he's under a trance," Fulton said. "Weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say." She went on to claim that Weston's breakdown was due to him veering off on his own after his 18th birthday.</p><p>She also added: "It's his dad's fault that he's in the hospital. He had his chance. He had his chance to make it right. My son had a healthy environment here. He had a system that was fantastic. I built that with myself and my team."</p><h2 id=yet-weston-blames-mom>Yet, Weston Blames Mom</h2><p>Despite his mom Christina's claim that it was all Nicolas' fault, Weston for his part, has always maintained that the blame lies&nbsp;with his mother. After his 2011 psychiatric hold, he was quoted saying to CNN: "I am an adult, I don't want to have anything to do with my mother. Any problems that I have ever had is because of the relationship that I had with my mother."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A couple of years later, he elaborated in an interview with Vice, that his strenuous relationship with his mother is because: "She has a victim complex, and the lyrics are interesting because they kind of mock the things she would say. "</p><p>"The things I have an issue with, all my arguments with her, stem from things she doesn’t realize exist. That’s the hardest thing. The two diseases she has are Munchausen by Proxy Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. With that combo, she’s always the victim, and I’m the most diseased person in the world. It’s disturbing," he added.</p><h2 id=arrested-for-getting-a-little-too-physical>Arrested For Getting A Little Too Physical</h2><p>Marriage didn't end up being as blissful as Weston may have hoped. Just a little over a month after being put on a psychiatric hold for losing his marbles over a menu item, Weston once again made headlines, but this time for a felony domestic violence charge. As initially reported by TMZ, both Weston and his wife at the time, Nikki Williams, were placed in custody. After posting the $50,000 bond, Weston was released and was photographed by paparazzi with some gnarly bruises on his arms. He also famously advised them: "Don't get married." Sound advice from a 20-year-old man (at the time).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nikki later admitted: "Weston and I did get physical with one another and he did not hit me in the face. We may be passionate, but we are not crazy."</p><h2 id=weston-and-his-wife-nikki-eventually-divorced>Weston And His Wife Nikki Eventually Divorced</h2><p>After the domestic violence charge, Weston announced that he would be divorcing Nikki. In a series of rambling posts, he also revealed on Facebook: "So don't judge of a battle where my vigor was abated by deathly amounts of booze. Never hit my wife. Why would I start abusing after she was positive after taking a pregnant-c test."</p><p>Even Nikki herself later admitted that she had been drinking at the time of the scuffle and this, despite knowing that she was pregnant. As terrible as drinking during the pregnancy obviously is, it still has us wondering: but where is the baby that Nikki was apparently pregnant with at the time of all this? There is effectively nothing on the net about what ended up happening after the couple divorced. Was it a prank?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=escaping-whitewashing-with-a-little-help>Escaping Whitewashing With A Little Help</h2><p>A couple of years before Hollywood whitewashing started making headlines more consistently, Nicolas Cage was already on a mission to address the problem. After wrapping up filming Outcast in China, Nick confided to the Daily Mail his hopes for the business: "I hope that we will see more Chinese actors in American cinema, too. We do see Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi and Chow Yun Fat, but it's very rare to see the Chinese male actor in Hollywood movies, which is something I take great umbrage with."</p><p>"My son is Asian. He may want to direct one day; he may want to be an actor like his father - and I want that to be open to him," he added.</p><p>He hasn't been vocal about the issue since his separation with Alice Kim, Kal-El's mother, but at least the thought was there. It's also possible that his youngest son simply isn't interested in pursuing acting just yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-weston-has-to-pave-his-own-way>But Weston Has To Pave His Own Way</h2><p>While Nick has been vocal about helping his youngest, he has never made the same kinds of statements with regards to his eldest son Weston, who has obviously had to work on his own to make a name for himself. So far, the name he has made for himself has been that of the troubled kid of a famous actor, but there is still plenty of time for time to turn that image around.</p><p>He had even posted a really cute throwback picture on his Insta of himself as a kid, standing alongside his famous father, with the caption: "I've been an actor since day one. Do you see a band? No. just me and my favorite man in existence."</p><p>Since putting his music on the back burner, it's clear that Weston has been trying to make a name for himself as an actor. Most notably, it's clear that he is very proud of his upcoming movie #211, along with Mesopotamia and Devotion, both of which are still in pre-production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=started-a-band-at-16>Started A Band At 16</h2><p>When most teens are busy sleeping in, secretly drinking and spending lots of time on their phones, Weston's focus was on his music. At just 16 years old, he started his first band, Eyes of Noctum. When most fans of a specific music genre wouldn't hesitate to give a new band or new songs a try before discarding them mentally, the fact that Weston is Nicolas Cage's son didn't actually work in his favor. Many were unwilling to give their first album Inceptum a chance, but once they did, we're actually blown away by his talent.</p><p>As a whole, the band garnered positive reviews for its symphonic and orchestral sounds and in particular, Weston was also praised for his vocal range. Although the band enjoyed some success, it eventually fell apart. Weston explained to Vice: “It was like a huge divorce […] So they all ganged up on me and wanted the removal of the orchestra which was so dear to me. I think that set us apart from other bands, but when they wanted the removal of cellos and violins, I started to despise the band. It definitely made me depart and go solo.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mastermind-behind-ghost-metal>Mastermind Behind Ghost Metal</h2><p>In that same interview with Vice, Weston also opened up&nbsp;about his interest in metal from a very young age. "I started with more atmospheric music, but I wanted to hear that coupled with something. First I found out about bands like Rammstein, who were using industrial elements, and System of a Down," he said.</p><p>With the downfall of his band Eyes of Noctum, Weston is now focusing his talents on Ghost Metal, a new music genre of his own creation. Although still struggling to find his own place in the spotlight, Weston’s newest album Prehistoric Technology was met with positivity in 2015, but three years later, there is still no word as to whether he has plans to release any more albums. Although he’s undeniably musically talented, his various interests, ranging from mixed martial arts to acting, are probably keeping him from focusing on only music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=occult-amp-spiritual-obsessions>Occult & Spiritual Obsessions</h2><p>Also in his interview with Vice, Weston opened up about his interest in the occult: "Poetic Eddas, Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, things like that. When I traveled in Italy and Greece, I saw places that were quite magical, like Stromboli. When I was in Corfu, I felt like Poseidon was right beside me in the waters".</p><p>Unlike many who immerse themselves in the occult, at least he's aware of how some might view him: "People see occult references in my lyrics and just think I’m crazy". He also went on to add: "[It's] weird because all the first scientists were alchemists". His justification is perhaps somewhat flawed given the ever-evolving nature of science and technology, but at least he was able to channel his interest in the occult into his music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=turning-his-life-around-or-did-he>Turning His Life Around...Or Did He?</h2><p>After ending his first marriage to Nikki Williams, Weston credited his next wife Danielle Cage for saving his life, revealing to People: "It’s a very joyous time right now". Before meeting her though, he thought that he was "digging [his] grave" by having 30 beers per day, along with a box of wine, hard liquor and pills. Basically, what didn't he take?</p><p>It wasn't until the birth of his child Lucien that he woke up and quit his addictions: "Having the combination of Danielle, Lucian and my father in my life - that trinity - is going to keep me here," he said. He also added: "He saved my life, he is my angel, it's just a very joyous time right now."</p><p>Cute, but sadly, things didn't work out with Danielle either, with him even getting slapped with a restraining order during the divorce proceedings.</p><h2 id=they-shouldn-t-have-been-named-cage>They Shouldn’t Have Been Named ‘Cage’</h2><p>Despite being the direct-to-video king, Nicolas Cage is undoubtedly still one of the best actors in Hollywood, but had he stuck to his original name, he wouldn't have been known as "Cage" at all. Born Nicolas Coppola, he decided to disassociate from the Coppola side of his name to avoid association to his famous uncle and film director Francis Ford Coppola. He changed his name instead of Cage as a tribute to the comic book superhero Luke Cage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lots of stars adopt stage names, but it's unclear whether Nicolas Cage's name change was ever made official in the face of the law. Even John Legend, whose real name is John Roger Stephens, named his kid Luna Simone Stephens, Vin Diesel, whose real name is Mark Sinclair, stuck with giving his real last name to his three kids, and the list goes on and on.</p><p>As it appears to only be his professional name, he technically shouldn't have added the name "Cage" to both of his kids names. When most kids nowadays adopt both the parents' last names, his kids' names instead carry both his real and professional last names: Weston Coppola Cage and Kal-El Coppola Cage. Having the name Cage in there has undoubtedly already helped Weston, but it remains to be seen if Kal-El will also take advantage of it to advance himself in Hollywood. Only time will tell as he is still only a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=third-time-s-the-charm-with-wife-number-3>Third Time’s The Charm With Wife Number 3</h2><p>Despite not even being 30 yet, Weston has already been married twice and is now on his third fiancé. He was first married to South African singer-songwriter Nikki Williams for two years when he was 21 years old and following a messy divorce, married Danielle Cage for just one year this time. It's also with Danielle that he had his son Lucian Augustus Coppola Cage.</p><p>Like father, like son though because Nick himself had actually proposed to his second wife Alice Kim just two months after they met. As it turns out, Weston is definitely following in his famous father's footsteps as he proposed to his current fiancé, real estate broker Hila Aronian, a whopping six months before finalizing his divorce with Danielle, as reported by Radar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear that Nic's eldest isn't very good at being alone, a fact even more obvious when reading his Insta posts. Nearly any time he posts a picture of himself with his fiancé, he also writes rants such as: "I went though hell to encounter the only one meant for me. Only she is faceted in the design to have successfully unlocked the unrelenting gold in my heart. I love you with a magnitude that will be written of for millennia. I would inhale planets for you. I am honored that everyone blesses this decision including my beloved son's and their amazing mother. Hila, my fellow royal. Mythology can't even compare to what I will give you. I am yours and my fire will bring you paradise. You look and sound of my muse."</p><h2 id=he-likes-to-air-his-dirty-laundry-all-the-time>He Likes To Air His Dirty Laundry All The Time</h2><p>Despite his grandiose professions of love, Nick's hot mess of a son is also quite vengeful and doesn't hesitate to air his dirty laundry for his fans to side with him. After getting into a violent spat with his first wife Nikki Williams, he actually posted a number of rants on Facebook, in particular writing: "Made my choice. Getting divorced."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He didn't keep it at that though. As reported by E Online, he had also added: "I'm not gonna be the one that gets dumped. Because it just wouldn't make sense. Why would I abuse the person I was trying to save?" he asked. "If I hit somebody which I haven't done in years...you want war, fine? Then let's have war. You want peace, I prefer that."</p><p>As already mentioned, he later also claimed that he would never hit a pregnant woman. Does that mean that he wouldn't hesitate hitting a woman if she wasn't pregnant? Nick's son is clearly troubled, but the real question is whether he's the victim that he claims to be or if the past women in his life have been the real victims.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eclectic-interests-just-like-dad>Eclectic Interests Just like Dad</h2><p>Throw some Italian blood, a dash of Roman pride manifested through Roman tattoos, and a fascination with the Slavic culture and you have yourself Weston Cage. More specifically, he has posted to his Instagram saying that "there is a very magical reason for [his] infatuation with Russian culture". But that magical reason appears to be solely based on his love of the martial art and combat sport Sambo, which had been developed by the Soviet Union in the early 1920's.</p><p>It's probably no coincidence that his father Nick is also well loved by the Russian community, especially since his portrayal of Ukrainian Yuri Orlov in Lord of War, a movie where Weston had a small role as well. And despite Kazakhstan being separated from the Russian empire since 1990, there is still something to be said about the Kazakh outfit that Nick once wore, effectively turning him into yet another Internet meme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=training-with-the-best>Training With The Best</h2><p>When your father is the One True God Nicolas Cage, you can train with pretty much anyone you want and that couldn't have been made clearer than through the picture that Weston shared on his Instagram. He has posted numerous videos and pictures of himself training, but it's the picture where he is seen training with Terry Claybon that is the most interesting. Weston isn't exactly a top notch MMA star or even a major Hollywood actor and yet when posting the pic, he accompanied it with the caption: "I've trained with this legendary pugilist since I was a kid. God bless you @terryclaybon. I miss you enormously. #lb4lb “what’s really going on!?” You don’t know what boxing is until you train with Terry."</p><p>For the record, Terry is a boxing coach and world-class instruction that is sought after by all the major stars. He has trained Muhammad Ali, along with Academy Award winners Denzel Washington, Nicolas Cage, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Kevin Spacey.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RadarOnline.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People.com</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> DailyMail.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EOnline.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK5qsDTpZxmo56kxK95xZqaratdlq%2BwwdNmpaKbn6GutHnCmp6eq12gtqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gabriela-barragan-reacts-to-below-deck-down-under-consent-scandal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gabriela Barragan Reacts to 'Below Deck Down Under' Consent Scandal">&larr;
