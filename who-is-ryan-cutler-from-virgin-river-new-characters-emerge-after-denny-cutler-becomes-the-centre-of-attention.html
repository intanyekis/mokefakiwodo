The show received immense popularity throughout 2020-2021, as it now has released Season 4 on July 20. The series is based on the “Virgin River” novel by Robyn Carr.</p><p>Its story begins with Melinda Monroe who went through so much pain; losing her unborn child, and her husband.</p><p>All she needed was a fresh start and to leave her past behind, and she stumbles upon a small town called Virgin River in Nothern California.</p><p>The show invests ample time specifically in developing and exploring the lives of the town’s residents. Doc’s supposed grandson Denny Cutler becomes the center of attention as he suddenly shows up and introduces himself as Doc’s grandson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=denny-cutlers-dad-amid-his-secrets></span>Denny Cutler’s Dad Amid His Secrets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kai Bradbury, playing Denny, comes to the Virgin River as a long-lost grandson of Doc Mullins’. Denny shows up at Docs’ door and introduces himself to be his grandson.</p><p>Doc welcomes his newfound grandson wholeheartedly, he is overjoyed and wants his grandson to be part of the Virgin River. However, some residents in the town, refuse to buy that story which seems suspicious. Town residents warn Doc about whether Denny has any ulterior motives over his inheritance.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dennys-secrets-in-virgin-river></span>Denny’s Secrets In Virgin River<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Denny starts appearing suspicious around Doc. While Denny was looking for some pills to alleviate his symptoms of Huntington’s disease, he discovers some financial papers that revealed the clinic’s current financial issues.</p><p>Denny had nothing to lose. So he went to the bank with some stash of cash and cleared all of the clinic’s financial records. He thought his father Ryan would be proud and would’ve wanted the same thing.</p><p>However, Doc and the people around the town were still suspicious of his recent behavior, they certainly had no idea what was going on.</p><p>Like, when Mel found him breaking into the drug cabinet. Although Denny covered all the financial records of the clinic using his father’s insurance money, while being grateful, Doc still wanted answers to his drug issues.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-ryan-cutler></span>What Happened To Ryan Cutler?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Doc was so certain that he never had any kids, let alone grandchildren. However, Denny begins explaining to him, how his grandmother Rose broke up with Doc and never told him about his son, Ryan Cutler.</p><p>At the time, Doc was starting his medical school, and Rose didn’t wish to mess up his study and career. As she left the town and grew her son Ryan elsewhere. Doc discovers he had a son and believes the story his grandson told him. However, he later finds out, that his son recently died.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=denny-suffered-huntingtons-disease-like-his-father></span>Denny Suffered Huntington’s Disease Like His Father<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Denny had Huntington’s disease, a terminal fatal genetic disorder that breaks down nerve cells in the brain.</p><p>During the series, he showed all the symptoms of Huntington’s disease. Impaired judgment, and forgetfulness, like in one of his interactions with Lizzie, he couldn’t recall what he said to her about him not liking theatre.</p><p>His father Ryan recently passed away due to the same disease that he inherited from his father. Knowing that he didn’t have much to live, Denny took on a path to visit and spend his last moments with his grandfather, Doc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yrsJqmXZjCtbjEq2Sfqp%2Biere10aCgp2WinsOmvoynnLBlk52us63CrZyrq12auqa%2Bxp5kmp6kmr9usMSnpbJlk6rBrbHRZpmem5%2BisrR506GcZpuVo8GzsYyonWaZpKmyr8DIqKVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-timeline-of-kobe-bryants-life-tragic-death-and-legacy-629509-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Timeline of Kobe Bryants Life, Tragic Death and Legacy ">&larr;
